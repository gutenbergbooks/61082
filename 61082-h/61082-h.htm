  <h2 class='c006'>STORY I<br /> <span class='large'>NEDDIE AND BECKIE IN TROUBLE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>So many different kinds of stories as I have
told you! My goodness me, sakes alive, and
some molasses popcorn! I should think you
would get tired of them.</p>

<p class='c011'>But I hope you do not, and, as everyone likes
something new once in a while, I thought I would
make up some new stories for you. I have been
telling you about rabbits and squirrels and ducks
and chickens. How would you like to hear now
about some little bear children? Not bad, savage
bears, you know, but nice, kind, gentle, tame ones
who always minded the papa and mamma bears,
went to bed when they were told, and all that.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course, I could tell you some stories about
bad, growly and scratchy bears if I wanted to,
but I’d rather not, if it’s all the same to you.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Now, then, for some bear stories.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once upon a time, not so very many years ago,
there lived in a house, called a cave, in the side
of a hill, a family of bears. Their cave-house was
not far from where Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow,
the puppy dogs, had their kennel, and the bear
cave was only a short distance away from where
Joie and Tommie and Kittie Kat lived.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were seven bears in the family, five
grown-up ones and two children. There was a
chap named Neddie, who was as nice a boy bear
as you would want to meet. And there was a
little girl bear named Beckie, and she was as
cute as a soap bubble, if not cuter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then there were the papa and mamma bears.
And their last name was Stubtail, for bears, you
know, have only a little, short stubby tail—hardly
a tail at all, to tell the truth. But still it is more
of a tail than Buddy and Brighteyes, the guinea
pig children, have.</p>

<p class='c011'>Also living with this same Stubtail family of
bears was an old gentleman bear named Uncle
Wigwag, and the reason he was called that was
because he was always playing tricks, or telling
jokes, and when he laughed, after he had fooled
anybody, he would wig and wag his head from
side to side.</p>

<p class='c011'>Also there was Aunt Piffy, who was so fat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>that she used to puff and pant as she came
upstairs, and lastly there was a real old bear
gentleman named Mr. Whitewash. He was
called that because he was all white—he was a
polar bear from the North Pole, and he always
wanted to sit on a cake of ice.</p>

<p class='c011'>So these bears lived together in the cave in the
side of the hill, and they did many things, about
which I shall have the pleasure of telling you.
Neddie and Beckie did the most things to tell
about, but, of course, sometimes the other bear
folks did things also.</p>

<p class='c011'>One day when Neddie and Beckie had come
home from their school, Mrs. Stubtail, the bear
lady, said to her children:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Neddie—Beckie, I wish you would walk a
little way through the woods, and meet your papa
when he comes home from his work in the bed
factory.” You see Mr. Stubtail worked at making
mattresses for beds. With his long sharp
claws he would make the inside of the mattresses
all fluffy and soft so, no matter how wide awake
you were, you always fell asleep when you
stretched out on one of the beds the bear gentleman
made.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why do you want us to meet papa?” asked
Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I want you to tell him to stop at the store
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>on his way home and bring some honey,” said
Mrs. Stubtail. “We are going to have hot cornmeal
biscuits and honey for supper.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, joy!” cried Beckie, clapping her paws
together. Then she waltzed around on her hind
paws and she and Neddie hurried off down the
road to meet their papa.</p>

<p class='c011'>As they were going along they heard a voice
calling to them:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, ho! Children, wait a minute! Here
comes your Uncle Wiggily with some ice cream
cones for you!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, let’s wait for our uncle, the rabbit gentleman,”
said Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>So he and Beckie waited, and they heard a
rustling in the bushes and their mouths were just
getting ready for the ice cream cones when out
popped Uncle Wigwag, the joking old bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! Ha!” he cried, laughing and wigging
and wagging his head. “That’s the time I fooled
you!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Neddie and Beckie were so disappointed that
they did not know what to say. Uncle Wigwag
was laughing at his joke, but when he saw how
badly the bear children felt he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind. I’ll give you each a penny and
you can buy yourself some ice cream cones.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So he did, and then Beckie and Neddie were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>happy, and they went on to meet their papa, while
Uncle Wigwag looked around for some one else
on whom he could play a joke.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We ought to meet papa soon now,” said
Neddie, as he looked under an old stump to see
if he could find any crabapples growing there.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A little farther on and we’ll see him,” spoke
Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>They went on a little more, and all of a sudden
Neddie saw a large hollow log lying on the
ground. It was just like a stovepipe, only bigger
and it had a hole all the way through it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! I’m going to crawl through that hollow
log!” cried Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Better not,” warned Beckie. “Maybe something
in it might catch you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pooh! I’m not afraid!” cried Neddie.
“Anyhow, I can look all the way through.
There’s not a thing in it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So he started to crawl through the hollow log,
but my goodness me, sakes alive and some onion
pancakes! Neddie had not gone very far before
he found the hole in the log getting smaller.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t believe I’ll be able to crawl through
to the other end,” thought the little boy bear.
Then he tried to back out, but he could not—he
was stuck fast inside the hollow log.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, help! Help!” cried Neddie, wiggling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>and trying to get out. But he was tightly held.
He could hardly move.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s the matter?” asked Beckie from
where she stood outside the hollow log.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m stuck! I can’t get out!” cried Neddie,
and his voice sounded as if it were down cellar.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wait! I’ll get a long stick and poke you
out, just like you poke out a bean that gets stuck
in your putty-blower,” said Beckie. So she got
a long stick, and poked it in through the hollow
log. All at once the stick came up against something
soft.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s that?” asked Beckie, surprised like.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Stop! Ouch! It’s me!” yelled Neddie.
“Stop it! You’re tickling my back.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I want to get you out,” said Beckie,
poking in the stick again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You can’t do it that way,” said her brother.
“I guess you’ll have to crawl in after me and
pull me out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right,” said Beckie kindly, “I will.”
So she climbed through the log from the same
end where her brother had gone in. “I’m coming,”
called Beckie. Then she grunted, all of a
sudden.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s the matter?” asked Neddie, anxious-like.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m stuck, too,” answered Beckie. “Either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>I am too fat, or this log is too small. I can’t move
either way, and I can’t help you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” cried Neddie. So there the two
little bear children were in trouble inside the
hollow log. They wiggled and squirmed and did
everything they could think of to get out, but it
was of no use. They were stuck fast.</p>

<p class='c011'>I don’t know how long they might have had
to stay, nor what might have happened to them,
had not their papa come along just then from the
bed factory. The bear gentleman heard cries
coming from the hollow log, and, listening a
moment, he knew they were made by his children,
Beckie and Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah ha!” cried Mr. Stubtail. “They are in
the hollow log! I’ll soon get them out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, with his strong claws, Mr. Stubtail
made a big hole in the side of the log, taking care
not to scratch Beckie or Neddie. Soon the hole
was large enough for the two bear children to
come out about the middle of the side of the log.
And, oh! how glad they were.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll never go in a hollow log again!” cried
Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nor I,” added Neddie. Then they told their
papa about their mamma wanting honey, and he
took them by the paws and led them to the store
where honey was sold and bought some. Next
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>they all went home to supper, and Uncle Wigwag
said it was a good joke on Beckie and Neddie
to get stuck in the hollow log. Perhaps it
was, but the bear children did not think so. But
they liked the honey, anyhow.</p>

<p class='c011'>So in the next story, if the jumping-jack
doesn’t fall off his stick down into the cake dish,
and get all covered with frosting so he looks
like a candy doll, I’ll tell you about Beckie and
the buns.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>STORY II<br /> <span class='large'>BECKIE AND THE BUNS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The next day, after Neddie and Beckie Stubtail,
the little bear children, had been caught
in the hollow log, and their papa had to claw
them out, they didn’t go to school. It was not
because they were not well enough, for, after
all, being stuck inside a hollow log doesn’t hurt
a bear child very much. You see they have a lot
of soft, fluffy fur on them.</p>

<p class='c011'>No, that wasn’t the reason Beckie and Neddie
didn’t go to school. And it wasn’t because it was
Saturday, either. No, it was because there was
no school on account of the teacher bear having
a toothache. And when a bear has the toothache
he really can’t do anything. He has to go to the
dentist right away.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was so with the teacher bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the outside of the school house door the
bear teacher hung a white piece of birch bark, on
which was printed:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>NO SCHOOL TO-DAY.</div>
    <div>I’VE GOT THE TOOTHACHE.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>“Oh, goodie!” cried Neddie when he read it,
and he felt so happy that he tried to wag his
little short tail, only he couldn’t.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, Neddie, I’m s’prised at you!” exclaimed
Tommie Kat, who, with his brother and
sister, Joie and Kittie, had also come to school.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I’m not glad ’cause teacher’s got the
toothache,” said Neddie Stubtail quickly, “it’s
just because there’s no school.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, then so’m I glad,” said Kittie Kat,
purring softly.</p>

<p class='c011'>So all the animal children went home on account
of the school being closed, and when Mrs.
Stubtail saw Beckie and Neddie coming up to
the cave-house, she exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, what does this mean?” The little
bears told their mamma, and Aunt Piffy, who
had just come up from down cellar, said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, if there is no (puff) school, I can
(puff) hear your (puff) lessons!” You see she
puffed because she was all out of breath.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no, thank you,” said Neddie quickly,
“we’ll have to-day’s lessons to-morrow, so we
don’t have to study any now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he went out to have some fun: and one
of the things he did was to watch his uncle Wigwag
and Mr. Whitewash, the polar bear gentleman,
building a new room onto the cave-house.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>It was a room made from a big hollow log—not
the same one that Neddie and Beckie had
been caught in, however, but another one. Mrs.
Stubtail wanted her cave-house made larger so
Uncle Wigwag suggested adding on a hollow
log for a sitting-room.</p>

<p class='c011'>So that’s what he and Mr. Whitewash were
doing, and Neddie helped them by getting in
their way every now and then, so they wouldn’t
work too fast and get all tired out. Finally
Uncle Wigwag said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Neddie, I wish you’d go to the store and
get me some red paint to color this log green.”
And, never thinking it was a joke, off Neddie
ran.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pretty soon after that his mamma wanted him
to go to the store to get her a yeast cake, so she
could make bread. But, as Neddie was not in
sight, Beckie went.</p>

<p class='c011'>On her way home with the yeast cake in her
paws Beckie had to go past a house where some
other bears lived. Now these bears were not
nice and good. In fact they were bad, and because
they were bad, and because the Stubtail
family was a family of good bears the bad bears
did not like them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Why, would you believe it? Often those bad
bears would take rabbit and squirrel and guinea
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>pig children off to their dens and keep them there
for ever and ever so long, just to be mean, you
know. But none of the Stubtails, or Mr. Whitewash,
or Uncle Wigwag, or Aunt Piffy would
do anything like that. Maybe Uncle Wigwag
would play a joke, or do something funny, but
nothing that was real mean.</p>

<p class='c011'>And once Mr. Whitewash met a little boy
kitten in the woods—Joie Kat I think it was.
And Joie was wiggling and squirming and
twisting this way and that.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s the matter, Joie?” asked Mr. Whitewash.
“Have you the measles?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” exclaimed Joie, “my back itches
me terribly, and I can’t reach the place to
scratch it. Oh, dear!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, there’s nothing worse than to have an
itchy place in your back and not be able to
scratch it. Mr. Whitewash, the polar bear,
knew that, so with his claws he gently scratched
Joie’s back for him and tickled the little kitten
boy very much.</p>

<p class='c011'>But if Joie had met one of the bad bears,
why, my goodness me, and some peanut butter
on your cracker! The bad bear would, just as
soon as not, have taken Joie off to his den and
made him pull chestnuts out of the fire for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>other bears to eat. That’s what it is to be a bad
bear!</p>

<p class='c011'>And that was the cave-house in the woods which
Beckie had to go past on her way home from
the store with the yeast cake. But she was not
afraid, even of the bad bears.</p>

<p class='c011'>However, one of the bad bears, looking out
of a window in his cave-house, saw her coming
and he said to his brothers:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! There’s that goody-goody little Stubtail
girl! I’m going to get her in here and pull
her hair!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How are you going to do it?” asked another
bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll show you!” spoke the first one.</p>

<p class='c011'>So he went to the cupboard and got a lot of
sweet buns. Bears, you know, love buns almost
more than anything else. If ever you see some
tame bears in a cage or in a park give them a few
buns, and see how they enjoy them. That is,
if the keeper lets you, not otherwise.</p>

<p class='c011'>So this bad bear, who wanted to pull Beckie’s
hair, just because she was good, threw a bun
out of his window. It fell close to the little
bear girl, who looked at it in surprise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha!” she exclaimed, “that is strange! I
wonder if it is raining buns from the sky?”
She looked up, but she could see none falling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>from the clouds, and because the bad bear who
had thrown the bun was hiding behind the window
curtains Beckie could not see him, either.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I’ll eat it,” the little animal said, and
she did, for it was a good bun, even if a bad
bear did throw it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha!” said one of the bad bears to his
brother, “I don’t see how you’re going to get
her in here to pull her hair just by tossing buns
at her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You just watch,” said the first bad bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he threw another bun, when Beckie
wasn’t looking, and this one he did not toss
quite so far. It fell nearer to the cave-house of
the bad bears.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh joy!” cried Beckie, seeing the second
bun, “someone is very good to me to-day!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ah! If she had only known.</p>

<p class='c011'>“See!” exclaimed one bad bear to the other,
“that’s how I’m going to get Beckie in here!
Every bun she picks up will bring her closer
and closer to us, and soon I can jump out and
grab her!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Oh, wasn’t he the bad old bear!</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, Beckie ate the second bun, and then
came a third one, sailing through the air.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, it surely is raining buns!” cried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Beckie in delight. “I mustn’t eat them all. I’ll
save some to take home to Neddie.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So she began to put the buns in her pocket,
and she never noticed that each one she picked
up brought her nearer and nearer and nearer
to the cave of the bad bears.</p>

<p class='c011'>The last bun was almost on their doorstep, and,
just as Beckie reached over for it, the bad bear
jumped out and grabbed her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh dear!” cried poor Beckie Stubtail.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the bad bears did not get a chance to take
her into their house. Just as they were going
to do it along came Mr. Whitewash, the kind
polar bear. He was looking for Neddie to tell
him Uncle Wigwag was only joking about the
red paint to make a log green. And then Mr.
Whitewash saw the bad bear grab Beckie who
had picked up the buns.</p>

<p class='c011'>And what do you think Mr. Whitewash
did?</p>

<p class='c011'>Why, the big, brave white polar bear went
right up to the bad black bear and he cuffed
him on the ears with his broad paws, and pushed
him back inside his own house, and then he
tickled that furry creature in the ribs until the
bad bear had to laugh whether he wanted to or
not, and then Mr. Whitewash just grabbed
Beckie up under his paw and hurried away home
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>with her. And, oh, how angry the bad bears
were, because they could pull no one’s hair.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Beckie, you must be very careful about going
near that bear house again,” said her mamma
when she heard the story.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will, but, anyhow, I got the buns,” said
Beckie, as she gave Neddie some.</p>

<p class='c011'>So that’s all now, if you please, but the next
story will be about Neddie and the bees’ nest—that
is, if the nutmeg grater doesn’t scratch the
piano and make it cry when the rubber doll tries
to play a song on it.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>STORY III<br /> <span class='large'>NEDDIE AND THE BEES’ NEST</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>One day, when Neddie and Beckie Stubtail,
the little boy and girl bears, started for school,
Uncle Wigwag, the funny old bear gentleman
who, with Mr. Whitewash, the polar bear, was
building a sitting-room on to the cave-house out
of a hollow tree log, said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Neddie, when you come back from your lessons
this afternoon I shall have something for
you to do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right,” answered Neddie politely, as he
stood up on his hind legs and reached for a
bunch of grapes growing on a vine in the woods.
“All right, Uncle Wigwag. Do you want me
to go after some blue paint to color a board
pink?” and Neddie laughed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wigwag laughed too, for you see he
was always playing jokes on Neddie and Beckie,
and he remembered when he had once sent the
little bear boy for the wrong kind of paint.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” answered the old gentleman bear,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>“nothing like that, Neddie; I just want to take
you for a walk in the woods, and have you go
see Uncle Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman,
with me. Uncle Wiggily is going to sell
his automobile and buy a new car, so maybe he’ll
give us his old one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, joy! I hope he does!” cried Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So do I!” exclaimed Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then she and her brother went to school and
learned their lessons, such as how to make beds
in hollow stumps, and how to scratch their letters
on the white bark of a birch tree and how
to keep out of dangerous traps, and all things
like that.</p>

<p class='c011'>And all the while Neddie was wondering
whether or not Uncle Wiggily would give them
his old automobile.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If he does,” thought the little bear boy, “we
can have lots of fun. It will be better than sliding
down hill or eating ice cream cones.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, after a while, school was out, and the
blackboards could take a rest and the pieces of
chalk could lie down on the back of the erasers
and go to sleep. Out trooped the animal children.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come on, Neddie!” cried Joie Kat, the kitten
boy. “Let’s have a game of tag!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Or run a race!” added Tommie Kat.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>“No, I’ve got to go home,” said Neddie.
“My uncle is going to take me with him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So he did not stop to play, but hurried on.
Beckie, however, played with Kittie Kat and
with Susie Littletail, the rabbit girl, and Alice
and Lulu Wibblewobble, the duck girls.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, here I am, Uncle Wigwag!” at last
called Neddie, as he ran up to the old bear gentleman.
“Come on!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just a minute, Neddie. Sit down on this
board while I saw it in two, will you? I want
it for the front steps,” said Uncle Wigwag.</p>

<p class='c011'>So Neddie, thinking nothing wrong, sat down
on the board, which was placed between two
stumps, resting on them. And no sooner had
Neddie seated himself, than “Crack!” went the
board, breaking right in the middle, and down
Neddie went. But he wasn’t hurt, for Uncle
Wigwag, when he played this trick, had placed
a pile of soft leaves for Neddie to fall on. They
were just like a cushion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Excuse my joke!” laughed Uncle Wigwag.
You see he had nearly sawed the board in two
before Neddie arrived, and when the little bear
boy sat on it the pieces were just held together
by a few shreds of wood. Of course, they easily
broke with Neddie’s weight.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, that’s all right! I don’t mind!” laughed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Neddie, brushing the dried leaves off his fur.
“You must have your joke, I suppose, Uncle
Wigwag.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed I must,” answered the old gentleman
bear. “But here is a penny for you to buy a
lollypop, because you took my trick so good-naturedly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Uncle Wigwag, shaking his head, set
off through the woods with Neddie to the house
of Uncle Wiggily, the rabbit gentleman, to ask
for the old auto.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hum! Let me see!” exclaimed Uncle Wiggily,
when Uncle Wigwag had asked him.
“My old auto, eh? Well, I will think about it.
Sit down, Mr. Wigwag, and I’ll consider it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And may I go off and buy a lollypop?”
asked Neddie, hoping that, by the time he came
back, Uncle Wiggily would have given Uncle
Wigwag the old auto.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, toddle off!” exclaimed Uncle Wigwag,
so Neddie toddled off.</p>

<p class='c011'>On and on he went through the woods, and
pretty soon he came to a tree on the side of which
he saw something sticky. A number of flies
were buzzing around it, and at first Neddie
thought it was flypaper. But when he went
closer he smelled something sweet, and putting
the tip of his paw on it, and then putting his paw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>to his mouth, Neddie found the sticky stuff on
the tree was honey; just as you wet the tip of
your finger when you want to see whether there
is sugar or salt in the pepper dish.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, ha! Honey!” cried Neddie. “I just
love honey! It is better than lollypops!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He put his red tongue on the sticky stuff, and
licked off all he could reach. Then he stretched
up with his paws and got more. Finally he
could reach up no farther.</p>

<p class='c011'>But he looked up, and he saw a big black
lump high in the tree, and Neddie said to himself:</p>

<p class='c011'>“That must be where the most honey is. I’ll
climb up and get some, and take some home to
mamma and Beckie.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, Neddie could climb a tree very well.
All bears can, even little baby ones, for they have
sharp claws for that very thing. So Neddie
got ready to climb, and before doing so he sang
this little song:</p>

      <div class='line'>“Honey, honey in a tree,</div>
      <div class='line'>Some for you and some for me.</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh! how I do love sweet honey,</div>
      <div class='line'>I can get this without money!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Then Neddie began to climb. Higher and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>higher he went in the tree, and as he went up he
could smell the sweet honey more and more, and
his mouth fairly watered for it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Neddie did not stop to think that the honey
was not his. All he thought of was how good it
would taste, and how much he wanted it. Nor
did he stop to ask himself what that funny buzzing
sound was, that seemed to come from inside
the tree.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, you honey!” gaily cried Neddie, as he
climbed higher.</p>

<p class='c011'>Finally he got to the big black lump, and,
surely enough, it was a pile of honeycomb, the
little holes being all filled with the sweet, sticky
stuff.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, this beats lollypops!” cried Neddie. “It
is better even than automobiles.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Neddie reached his paw into the middle of the
black mass and scooped out a lot of honey. He
put it in his mouth and began to chew on it. It
was so good that he just had to shut his eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yum! yum!” cried Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, if he had had his eyes open Neddie might
have seen a lot of bees flying out of the hollow
honey tree. But he did not look. He was thinking
too much of the sweet stuff. Out buzzed the
bees, and they were very angry that some one had
come to take their sweet stuff. And, small as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>they were, the bees were not afraid of Neddie,
who was quite a large bear boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!” went the bees. “Get
away from our honey!” Then they flew at Neddie,
and with their sharp stings they stung him
on the end of his soft and tender nose, and on
the bottom parts of his paws, where they had no
fur, and on his ears; and some of the bees even
snuggled down in his fur and stung him through
that.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, wow!” cried Neddie, as he felt the
needle-like stings. Then he opened his eyes
quickly enough.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Get away from our honey!” buzzed the bees,
and Neddie was glad to slide down that tree
more quickly than he had climbed up it. Oh! how
his nose smarted, and his paws! He seemed on
fire all over. He licked the honey off his paws,
but it did not taste good any more.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, wow! Double wow!” howled poor Neddie,
and then he started to run home as fast as
he could. And on the way he met Uncle Wigwag,
who soon knew what the matter was.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some cool, wet mud on your nose will stop
the pain,” said the bear gentleman, and he took
Neddie to a brook and made him a nice mud-plaster.
Then Neddie felt better, but he said
he would never go near a bees’ honey nest again.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>“And did Uncle Wiggily give you the auto?”
asked Neddie of Uncle Wigwag on their way
home.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is still thinking about it,” said Uncle
Wigwag. “Oh, but your nose is all swelled up
like a football, Neddie.” And so it was. But in
a few days it was all better.</p>

<p class='c011'>And in the story after this, if the horse radish
doesn’t run away with the spoon-holder and scare
the knives and forks off the sideboard, I’ll tell
you about Beckie and the grapes.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>STORY IV<br /> <span class='large'>BECKIE AND THE GRAPES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The nose of Neddie Stubtail, the little bear
boy, was so badly swelled from the bee stings,
after he took some of their honey, that he could
not go to school next day, nor for some days
after that. I told you in the story before this
how Neddie got stung.</p>

<p class='c011'>So Neddie’s mamma let him stay home from
school, but even at that he could not have much
fun, for he could not go out and play, and what
is the good of staying home from school if you
have to remain in the house all the while?</p>

<p class='c011'>There were two reasons for Neddie’s staying
in the cave-house, on the side of the green hill,
and not going out. One reason was that most
of the day all his boy animal friends were at their
lessons in school.</p>

<p class='c011'>The other reason was that when Neddie did
go out with them, they all looked at his stung
and swollen nose in such a funny way that it made
him feel queer. He did not like it.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>Sammie Littletail, the rabbit boy, would ask:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is the matter, Neddie? Did you bite
yourself, or fall downstairs?”</p>

<p class='c011'>And Johnnie and Billie Bushytail, the squirrel
brothers, would say:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, Neddie, did your Uncle Wigwag play
a trick on you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Joie or Tommie Kat would want to
know:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Neddie, did you fall out of bed in your sleep,
and bump your nose?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Neither one! Now you stop!” Neddie
would exclaim, and then he’d go in the house.
Oh, he was sorry in more ways than one that he
had ever meddled with the bees’ nest, even if he
did get some honey out of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>But one afternoon, when Neddie had come in
the house because the other animal boys plagued
him so, Mrs. Stubtail, the bear mamma, whispered
to Beckie, who was Neddie’s sister:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Beckie, you know Neddie feels pretty badly,
don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, mamma, I do. His nose must pain him
very much.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed it does. Now I’d like to give him
a little treat. Suppose you go to the store and
get him some ice cream. That will cool off his
nose and he will feel better.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>“Of course I’ll go, mamma!” exclaimed
Beckie. So she put on her little red cloak and
bonnet and off through the woods she went to
where Jack Frost kept an ice cream store.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beckie got a nice big box of ice cream for her
brother, and on her way back through the woods
the little bear girl saw some lovely bunches of
wild grapes hanging on a vine. They were almost
the last of the season and soon the grapes
would be all gone, for the animals of the woods,
and the birds of the air, would eat them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m going to pick some nice bunches, and
take them home to Neddie,” thought Beckie
kindly. “Maybe he’ll like them with his ice
cream.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Beckie set down the box of frozen sweet
stuff, and began pulling off some bunches of wild
grapes with her long claws, which were to her
just what your fingers are to you.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, in a little while, not so very long, Beckie
heard some one coming up behind her, sort of
slow and careful like, and she quickly turned
around. For she knew there were bad animals
in the wood, who would be glad to carry her off
to their dens. Beckie was a very sweet, fat little
bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>But all Beckie saw, when she turned around
was Mr. Fuzzytail, the fox gentleman.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>“Ah, Ha!” exclaimed Mr. Fuzzytail. “Good
afternoon, Beckie! I hope I see you well.
Gathering grapes, I observe!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” answered Beckie, wondering why Mr.
Fuzzytail was so polite to her. Usually he hardly
spoke, always going past as if he were in a great
hurry. And when she saw Mr. Fuzzytail smiling
in such a sly way, Beckie knew the fox gentleman
had some reason for his politeness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Beautiful day; isn’t it?” went on Mr. Fuzzytail,
pretending to look at his paws, to see if there
were any stickers on them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” said Beckie. “Would you like some
grapes?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Beckie thought she would be just as polite as
that fox was, and maybe she could find out what
he was after.</p>

<p class='c011'>“For he is after something,” decided the little
bear girl, “and it isn’t grapes, either.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Grapes? Why, yes, if you will be so kind
and condescending as to stoop so low without
bending, I would be thankful for a small bunch,”
spoke Mr. Fuzzytail, very, very politely indeed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, he’s surely up to some trick,” thought
Beckie. “I must find out what it is. He’s as bad
at tricks as our Uncle Wigwag.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Beckie was not afraid of the fox. She was
larger and stronger than he was, even if she was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>only a small bear girl. Of course, Kittie Kat, or
Lulu or Alice Wibblewobble, the duck girls,
would have feared Mr. Fuzzytail, but Beckie did
not.</p>

<p class='c011'>So she picked a nice bunch of grapes for him,
and while he was slowly eating them, picking off
the bad ones, Beckie looked all about. But she
could see no danger. And, all the while, Mr.
Fuzzytail kept talking to Beckie. He asked her
all sorts of questions—how she was getting on at
school, how her brother’s stung nose was, what
her papa worked at, and whether Aunt Piffy’s
epizootic was any better. Oh, that fox was a
sly fellow!</p>

<p class='c011'>And now I’ll tell you why he was so polite,
and why he stayed there talking to Beckie, and
why he ate his grapes so slowly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Do you remember the bad bears who lived in
the woods? Yes. Well, do you remember how
once they tried to get Beckie into their caves, by
tossing buns to her, so they could pull her hair?</p>

<p class='c011'>Oh, you do. Very good! Well, these same
bears, or rather, one of them, was after Beckie
again. He was the largest and the worst of the
bad bears, too.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had seen Beckie start off to the store, and
he made up his mind he’d get her. Only he knew
that if he followed along she might hear him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>tramping over the sticks, for he was a very heavy
bear. And he knew that if he started to run after
Beckie he could not catch her, for she was light
on her paws and swift to run.</p>

<p class='c011'>So the bad bear planned a trick. He met Mr.
Fuzzytail, the fox, and said to him:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now you creep along after Beckie. She
won’t be afraid of you, and if you can keep her
there by the grape vine for a while, by talking to
her, it will give me a chance to sneak up behind
the bushes and grab her before she knows what is
happening. Will you do it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will,” said Mr. Fuzzytail, for he was afraid
of the big bad bear. So that’s how it was the fox
kept on talking to Beckie as she picked the
grapes. He wanted to keep her attention so she
would not notice the bear sneaking up on her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Finally Beckie said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I must be going now. Good-by, Mr.
Fuzzytail.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, good-by,” said the sly fox, and out of the
corner of his eye he saw the bad bear behind the
grape vine. The bear had sneaked up without
Beckie hearing him, because she was so busy in
being polite to the fox. “Good-by, Beckie,”
went on Mr. Fuzzytail. And then to himself he
said: “I guess you won’t go very far.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, Beckie leaned over to pick up the box of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>ice cream that she had bought for Neddie and
just then, with a loud roar, out from behind the
grape vine sprang the bad bear:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! This is the time I have you!” he cried
to Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beckie jumped so that the box of ice cream
slipped out of her paw and fell to the ground.
The paper box hit a sharp stone, burst open and
out ran the ice cream all over, for it had melted
when Beckie stopped to pick the grapes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wow!” cried the bad bear, as he made a
jump for Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>But he never reached her. Beckie leaped back
just in time, and the bear came down with his
paws in the puddle of the slippery ice cream.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bang!” he went. His feet slid out from
under him, just as if he were coasting down hill
backward, and he got so tangled up with himself
that by the time he was untangled Beckie had run
away and gotten safely home. Oh, how she ran!
No bad bear could catch her.</p>

<p class='c011'>The bad creature who had gone to all this
trouble to catch Beckie got up out of the ice
cream. He was a funny looking sight, all splattered
up and plastered with dried leaves.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This was all your fault!” he cried to the fox.
“Be off before I bite you!” And the sly fox
was glad enough to go.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>So that’s how Beckie got away from the bear
by means of the slippery ice cream. She told her
mamma what had happened, and Mrs. Stubtail
sent Uncle Wigwag to the store for more ice
cream for Neddie. So the little bear, who was
stung by the bees, had some, after all, and everybody
was happy except the bad bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>And in the following story, if the chocolate
drop doesn’t fall out of the window and get all
squashed flat on the postman’s umbrella, I’ll tell
you about Neddie and the trained bear.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>STORY V<br /> <span class='large'>NEDDIE AND THE TRAINED BEAR</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Come on out and have some fun!” called
Tommie Kat, the little kitten boy, to Neddie
Stubtail, the little bear chap, one afternoon when
all the animal children had come home from
school. “Come on out, Neddie!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Neddie had just entered the cave-house, where
he lived with his mamma and papa and the rest
of the bear folk. Neddie tossed his books into
one corner, his hat into another and then he called
out:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I’m hungry, I want something to eat!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind about eating,” said Tommie Kat,
“come on have some fun.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I must eat!” cried Neddie, and he rushed
out toward the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, as it happened, just then Aunt Piffy,
the fat lady bear who lived with Mrs. Stubtail,
being her sister, in fact; Aunt Piffy, as it happened,
just then, was coming in from the kitchen
with a large plate of doughnuts she had just
baked.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>And, of course, Neddie, being in such a hurry,
ran right into Aunt Piffy, doughnuts, plate and
all, and then——</p>

<p class='c011'>Oh dear! Such a time as there was!</p>

<p class='c011'>Aunt Piffy suddenly sat down, and it is a
mercy she didn’t sit on Neddie, for if she had
there would have been quite a sad happening, as
Aunt Piffy was very large and stout. And the
plate fell from her paws, and broke into twelve
pieces, or maybe thirteen, for all I know, and the
doughnuts rolled all over the floor, one even
bumping down the cellar stairs.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! What happened?” gasped Aunt
Piffy, and she could hardly breathe, she was so
excited.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I—I guess I happened,” said Neddie, looking
all around at the scattered doughnuts. “But
I—I didn’t mean to,” he added. “I’ll help pick
up the cakes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“First, if you please, help me up,” said Aunt
Piffy, puffing and blowing to get her breath.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll help you!” exclaimed Tommie Kat, for
he had heard, from out on the porch of Neddie’s
cave-house, the noise of the fall and had come in
see what had caused it.</p>

<p class='c011'>So Tommie and Neddie helped Aunt Piffy
get up on her hind paws, and then Neddie began
gathering up the spilled cakes.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>“May I help at that, too?” asked Tommie,
and Aunt Piffy answered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should be glad to have you. And you may
have a doughnut, Tommie.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How about me?” asked Neddie, thinking
perhaps he did not deserve one for having been
in such a hurry as to make his Aunt Piffy tumble
down.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, well; yes, I guess you may have one
also,” said the bear lady. By this time she had
her breath again and soon Neddie and Tommie
had picked up the doughnuts. They each kept
one and ate them as they went out to play.</p>

<p class='c011'>But they had not been out long before Mrs.
Stubtail called to her little bear boy:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Neddie, come right in here and pick up your
things! You have scattered your books all over,
and your school cap is on the floor.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, ma, I don’t want to!” exclaimed Neddie;
but his mamma made him, because it is not good
for boys to be careless and scatter things all over
the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Neddie could play, and he and Tommie
had lots of fun. They frisked about in the
woods, for it was cold and jumping about made
them warm. Then Tommie said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, let’s go over and see Uncle Wiggily, the
rabbit gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>“All right, we will,” spoke Neddie. “And
I’ll ask him if he has yet made up his mind about
giving his old automobile to Uncle Wigwag.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So the kitten boy and the little bear chap went
over to the hollow stump where the old gentleman
rabbit lived, but he was not at home, having gone
for a ride with Grandfather Goosey Gander, the
duck gentleman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, let’s take a walk in the woods and see
if an adventure will happen to us,” suggested
Tommie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right,” agreed Neddie, and off they went.
They had not gone far before they met Dickie
Chip-Chip, the sparrow boy, flying through the
air, and Dickie said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Tommie Kat, your mamma is looking
all over for you. She wants you to go to the
store.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I’d better go home,” said Tommie, and
off he ran with his tail up in the air like a fishing
pole. That left Neddie all alone, for Dickie Chip
Chip could not stay to play with him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind,” thought Neddie, “I’ll look for
an adventure by myself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He went on and on, and pretty soon he came
to a big hole in the ground. He was looking
down in it, thinking perhaps some new bear might
live there, when, all of a sudden, up from the hole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>was poked a long nose, and then Neddie saw a
big mouth, filled with shining white teeth, and a
voice cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, ha! Now I have you!” And the first
thing Neddie knew the skillery-scalery alligator,
with the humps on his tail, had grabbed him by
the back of his neck.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, let me go! Let me go!” cried Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I’ll not!” said the alligator, speaking in
a thick voice, like cold potatoes, for you see he had
hold of Neddie by his teeth, and he could not talk
very well, that alligator couldn’t.</p>

<p class='c011'>Neddie wiggled this way and that and tried
to get loose. It did not hurt him very much, for
there was thick fur on the back of his neck, and
the alligator’s teeth did not go through. It was
just like when the mamma cat carries her little
kittens, you know, in her mouth by the backs of
their necks. Only you must not carry the kittens
that way unless papa or mamma shows you
how, for you might choke them. And I know
you wouldn’t do that for the world.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anyhow, there the alligator had hold of Neddie
by the loose skin at the back of the little boy
bear’s neck, and the skillery-scalery creature was
trying to drag Neddie down into the hole in the
ground.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let me go! Let me go!” begged Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>“Nope! Nope!” said the ’gator, pulling
harder than ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>Neddie braced with his claws in the dirt, but, in
spite of this, he was being dragged along, for the
alligator was bigger and stronger than the bear
boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Neddie was almost down in the hole and he
was wishing he had not gone off alone to look for
an adventure, when right behind him, he heard
a large bear growling. At first he hoped it was
his papa or Uncle Wigwag, the joking bear, or
even Mr. Whitewash, the polar bear gentleman,
who had come to save him. But when he looked
he saw it was a strange man-bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>However, that strange man-bear was very
kind to Neddie. Rushing up to the alligator, the
big bear just tickled him on his thick and scaly
hide with his sharp claws, and that ’gator was so
tickled, and he had to laugh so hard, that he let
Neddie go.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quick now!” cried the big bear, “jump out
of the way, little bear boy!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And you may be sure Neddie got out of the
hole and the skillery-scalery alligator, still laughing
at being tickled, went and hid in the woods
and did not come out for a day and a half.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Neddie looked at the bear gentleman who
had saved him. This bear was very nice and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>kind-looking, only he had an iron ring in his nose,
and fastened to the ring was a long chain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is that for?” asked Neddie, after he
had gotten over being frightened.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is so I will not get lost,” said the other.
“You see I am a tame bear, and do tricks, and
my master has this ring in my nose, and leads
me around by it so I will not go away. And he
feeds me buns and popcorn. Oh, it’s nice to be
a trained bear!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A trained bear, eh?” said Neddie. “Are
you like a train of cars that I got for Christmas?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I am trained to do tricks,” said the tame
bear. “See, I will show you,” and he stood on
his head and turned a somersault, and then
waltzed around in a circle. “Would you not like
to learn to do those things?” he asked Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Maybe,” said the little bear boy, who was not
quite sure.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then come with me,” invited the tame
bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>But just then there was a rustling in the bushes
and out came a real man with a long pole and a
brass horn. And he took hold of the tame bear’s
nose chain and looked at Neddie, the man did.
And as Neddie had been taught to be always
afraid of men, the bear boy ran home through the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>woods as fast as he could, and told all that had
happened to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was a narrow escape for you,” said his
papa. Then supper was ready and Neddie and
Beckie, his sister, ate as much as was good for
them, and not a bit more, I do assure you.</p>

<p class='c011'>And in the next story, if the raisins in the rice
pudding don’t all hop out and leave it as full
of holes as a Swiss cheese sandwich, I’ll tell you
about the little Stubtails running away.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>STORY VI<br /> <span class='large'>THE STUBTAILS RUN AWAY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“What are you thinking of, Neddie?” asked
Beckie Stubtail, the little bear girl, one Saturday
morning when there was no school and when she
and her brother were out in front of the cave-house
brushing up the dried leaves to make a bonfire.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I’m not thinking of much,” said Neddie,
with a look through the woods to see if he could
see his Uncle Wigwag trying to play any tricks
on him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, but you must be thinking of something,”
insisted Beckie. “For I have had to speak to
you twice before you answered, and when mamma
asked if you didn’t want to scrape out the frosting
dish when she was making a cake, you said:
‘I would if I didn’t have to have a ring in my
nose.’ What in the world did you mean,
Neddie?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush!” exclaimed the little bear boy, looking
all around. “Not so loud. Some one may
hear you!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>“Well, what if they do?” asked Beckie in surprise.
“I only said what you said about having
a ring in your nose——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush, that’s it!” exclaimed Neddie. “You
know——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know you said the tame trained bear had
one,” went on Beckie, “but what has that got
to do with you!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush!” exclaimed Neddie, coming nearer
and taking hold of Beckie’s paw, “that’s it,
Beckie. How would you like to become a trained
bear and do tricks, Beckie?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Like it? Why, I wouldn’t like it at all!” exclaimed
the little bear girl. “I think it would
be perfectly horrid to have a ring in your nose.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, maybe we wouldn’t have to,” went
on her brother. “That’s what I’ve been thinking
of.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, Neddie Stubtail!” exclaimed Beckie.
“I’m going straight and tell mamma! The very
idonical idea!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, don’t do that!” cried Neddie, grabbing
his sister by the paw before she could run into
the cave-house. “Wait and I’ll tell you about
it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I know,” spoke Beckie, and tears came
into her eyes. “You’re thinking of running away
and becoming a trained bear! Oh, don’t do it!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>“Why not?” asked Neddie. “I think it would
be fun. You know the day the skillery-scalery
alligator had me by the neck, the good tame bear
came along and tickled the ’gator so that he had
to let me go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” said Beckie. “I remember that, but
I don’t see why——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Listen!” went on Neddie, just as the nice
telephone girl says it, “listen and I’ll tell you all
about it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Beckie listened as hard as she could.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The trained tame bear said he could do lots
of tricks,” went on Neddie, “and he did some for
me. And he also said the man gave him buns and
popcorn and lots of good things to eat.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, but papa has always taught us to be
afraid of real men,” said Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, maybe real men, with guns and dogs.
But this man only had a stick, like mamma’s
clothes pole, and a brass trumpet. And as I ran
away through the woods I could hear him blowing
a lovely tune on it. I’m sure he was a good
man.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, maybe,” admitted Beckie. “But are
you going to run away and become a tame trained
bear?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m thinking of it,” answered Neddie. “And
maybe you would like to come, too. Just imagine—sweet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>buns every day—and popcorn balls, no
lessons—and doing tricks, and having that man
play on the brass horn for you——”</p>

<p class='c011'>Now it wasn’t right of Neddie to do this, and
try to make Beckie come away with him. It
was bad enough for the little boy bear to think of
going off by himself. But when he wanted his
sister to come, too—well, it wasn’t right; that’s
all. Neddie was older than Beckie and he should
have known better. But that’s the way it is
sometimes, even with boys in real life. Of course
I don’t mean any of you, but there are some
other children I could name if I wanted to. But
I’m not going to.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, anyhow, Neddie talked of how nice it
would be for him and Beckie to run away, and
become trained bears, and do tricks, and have
good things to eat and finally Beckie said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I’ll run away for a little while with
you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, we’ll just try it. If we don’t like it we
can run back again,” spoke Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow, the puppy
dog boys, once ran away,” said Beckie, “and
they were glad enough to run home again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know, but this is different,” said Neddie;
“they went to join a circus. We’ll just go with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>a kind man. There will be all the difference in
the world.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right, we’ll try it,” said Beckie, and she
sighed a little at the idea of leaving her mamma
and papa and Uncle Wigwag, and Aunt Piffy
and Mr. Whitewash, the polar bear gentleman,
and her nice cave-house, and all that.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Could I take any of my dolls with me?”
asked Beckie, after a bit.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, maybe one,” said Neddie, “though I
never heard of anybody that ran away taking a
doll. But maybe one won’t do any harm.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I’m going to take Maryann Puddingstick
Clothespin, my very nicest doll,” said
Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right,” agreed her brother. “Now we
must get ready. And, mind you, it’s a secret.
No one must know anything about it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can’t I tell—tell mamma?” asked Beckie,
tears coming in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, not even mamma.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I’m not going!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, that’s just like you girls!” cried Neddie.
“We fellows get everything going nicely and
you won’t play fair. You can leave a note for
mamma, after we’re gone, telling that you’ve run
away, if you like.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I’ll do it,” said Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>“And you must pack up what clothes you’ll
need,” went on Neddie. “Put ’em in a paper
bag, and I’ll do the same. Then when it gets
dark we’ll go out and run away to find the man
with the brass horn.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And when will we get some sweet buns and
popcorn?” asked Beckie, anxious-like.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, as soon as we find him,” said Neddie.
“Now I’m going to get ready. Mind! Not a
word to anybody.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So the two bear children prepared to run
away. Of course I’m not saying they did right—I
guess you wouldn’t say so yourself, but I have
to tell this story exactly as it happened, or it
wouldn’t be fair. Of course I might make a mistake,
but I’ll do as nearly right as I know
how.</p>

<p class='c011'>Neddie and Beckie packed up a few of their
clothes in paper bags they found in the kitchen.
Beckie also took some things for her doll,
Maryann Puddingstick Clothespin. The doll
herself the little bear girl wrapped in an old
salt bag that had been washed clean.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wonder what those two children are up to
anyhow?” asked Aunt Piffy, the fat bear lady
as she helped Mrs. Stubtail do the washing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, maybe they’re planning some trick to
play on Uncle Wigwag, to pay him back for all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>the joking he has done,” said Mrs. Stubtail. “I
guess they’re all right.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But if she had only known what Neddie and
Beckie were going to do. Oh dear! Isn’t it too
bad mothers don’t always know? They could
save so much trouble!</p>

<p class='c011'>But there! I must tell about the story.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beckie and Neddie had their supper, and they
had hidden their bags of things out under the
front porch. They were not very hungry. They
were too excited; and then, too, they were thinking
of what the bear man might give them. Perhaps
they were also a little sad about leaving
their nice home. But Neddie had made up his
mind to run away.</p>

<p class='c011'>Finally the bear children went off to bed. But
they did not sleep, and when the house was all
dark and still they quietly got up and went out
the back door. Silently they went to where they
had left their bundles and got them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come on!” whispered Neddie. “At last
we’re running away!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And—and—maybe we’ll be glad to—run
back again!” whispered Beckie, and her voice
choked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, don’t be a cry-baby!” said Neddie.
“Come on!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, but it’s dark!” objected Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>“The moon will soon be up,” said her brother.</p>

<p class='c011'>On and on through the woods they went,
and soon the moon did come up. Then it was
lighter. On and on went the two bear children;
when, all of a sudden, they heard a noise in the
bushes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s that?” asked Beckie, sliding close
up to her brother.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I—I don’t know,” he whispered. And just
then, through the woods, they heard a sound like
this:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ta-ra! Ta-ra-ta! Ta-ra-ta! Ta-ra-ta!
Toot! Toot!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come on!” cried Neddie, joyfully. “There
is the trained bear man. Now we are all right,”
and holding tightly to Beckie’s paw he raced on
through the woods toward the bugle sound.</p>

<p class='c011'>And what happened next, and what Neddie
and Beckie did when they found the trained
bear and his master, I’ll tell you on the next page,
when the story will be about Neddie and Beckie
up a pole—that is I will if the letter-carrier
doesn’t put a clothespin on our little doggie’s tail
and mail him away off where he can’t go to the
moving picture show in our cellar.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>STORY VII<br /> <span class='large'>NEDDIE AND BECKIE CLIMB A POLE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>When Neddie and Beckie Stubtail, the two
little bear children, had run away from home, as
I told you in the story before this one, and had
come to the woods where they heard the horn
blowing, they did not know just what to do.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That,” said Beckie, as she held her doll,
Mary Ann Puddingstick Clothespin, tightly in
her arms, “that surely must be the kind man
who has the trained bear with the ring in his
nose. Now we are safe and we will get many
good things to eat, Neddie.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We had better take a peep before we run
out from behind this bush,” said Neddie, slow
and careful like. “Perhaps it is some other
man with a horn, trying to fool us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>You know the bear children had met in the
woods, one day, a nice, kind trained bear, and
with him was a man called the Professor, who
led the bear around by a rope, fast to a ring in
the bear’s nose. And the trained bear did
tricks, such as turning somersaults and standing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>on his head, while the man collected, in his hat,
pennies that people tossed to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>The trained bear invited Neddie to travel
around with him, promising that he would have
popcorn and other good things to eat, but at
first Neddie was afraid of the man with the
brass horn.</p>

<p class='c011'>So he ran home; but the more Neddie thought
of it the more he wanted to run away and become
a traveling trained bear. So he got his
sister Beckie to go with him, and away they ran
in the evening, leaving their home and their
papa and mamma; and Aunt Piffy, the fat bear
lady, and Uncle Wigwag, and Mr. Whitewash,
the polar bear, and all their friends. Then they
came to the woods and heard the brass trumpet
blowing, as I have told you.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can you see anything?” asked Beckie, as
she looked over her brother’s head, while he was
peering through the holes in a bramble bush.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not yet,” answered Neddie. Just then
there came another blast on the brass trumpet,
and Neddie cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes! There he is!” And then Beckie
saw the tame bear with the ring in his nose,
instead of in an ear where some ladies wear
theirs, and with the tame bear was the man with
the long pole.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>“Now, George,” the man was saying, “I
guess we’ll go to sleep, and in the morning we’ll
do some more tricks and get more pennies.
Whoop-la! There’s your supper, George!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I guess it’s time for us to run out now,” said
Neddie to his sister, when he heard the word
supper.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” said Beckie, “I guess it is.” You see
it was really after supper time, and Beckie and
Neddie had eaten theirs before they ran away
from home. But running away makes you
hungry, whether you’ve had supper or not, I
suppose.</p>

<p class='c011'>Out ran the two bear children, and Beckie
especially was very glad they had found the
tame bear, for it was getting real late, and,
though the moon was shining brightly, still she
wanted company.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hello, what’s this!” cried the man with the
pole, as he saw Neddie and Beckie running toward
him. “More bears! Are they going to
bite me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no!” quickly answered the trained bear,
“I know who they are. One of them is a friend
of mine whom I met in the woods the other day.
I invited him to come with me, and I see he has
brought his sister. Perhaps you would like to
train them to do tricks.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“Ha! I think I would,” said the man. “They
might do tricks very nicely with you. I’ll have
a regular bear family,” and he pulled some
pieces of dried bread out of a bag on his arm,
and, taking some himself, he gave the rest to the
trained bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you please,” said Neddie, making a polite
bow, so low that his little tail almost pointed to
the sky. “If you please, did we hear you mention
supper?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You did,” answered the man. “It is
supper time for me and George—rather late, it is
true, but still supper time. My bear’s name
is George,” he added. “Eat your supper,
George.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am eating it,” said the trained bear, speaking
in his own language, which the man understood,
and spoke also. Not many men can speak
bear language, but this one could because his
head was all bare. He was a bald-headed man,
and they can mostly always speak a bear
language.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But what about something to eat for us?”
asked Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” added Neddie, “we’re hungry, and
you know, George,” he said, speaking to the
trained bear, “you said something about popcorn
and cake and lollypops—”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>“I know I did,” answered the trained bear,
sort of confused like and puzzled, as he ate his
dried bread. “But I didn’t mean I had popcorn
every day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should say not!” exclaimed the man,
whose name was Professor. “The idea! I’d
soon be in the poorhouse if I gave George popcorn
every day. That’s only for Thanksgiving,
or Christmas, or the like. But you are welcome
to some dried bread.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he gave Neddie and Beckie some bread
from the bag, and the two bear children had to
take it. They did not like it very much, but it
was the best they could get, and they were
hungry.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Running away isn’t as nice as staying home,”
whispered Beckie to her brother, after she had
put her doll to sleep under some dried leaves.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, well, it will be nice to-morrow,” spoke
Neddie. “And, anyhow, it will be Thanksgiving
in a couple of days, and then we’ll have plenty
of good things to eat.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wonder where we will sleep?” went on
Beckie. “I don’t see any nice cave-house, such
as we have at home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should say not!” cried Neddie. “You
don’t live in a house after you’ve run away.
The idea! We’ll live out of doors, and we won’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>have to wash our faces and paws when we don’t
want to.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I never mind doing that, anyhow,” said
Beckie, who was a very clean little bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, Neddie and Beckie finished their dried
bread, and they wished they had some buns, or
maybe even some ice cream, for all I know, and
then the man said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, it is not so very late, and there is a nice
moon, so I think I will see if you little new bears
can do any tricks. Come now, climb that pole!”
and he pointed to a telegraph pole growing in
the woods.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, we can’t climb that,” said Neddie,
quickly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why not?” asked the man with the bald
head. “You must climb it if you are to be trick-trained
bears.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, the pole is too smooth and slippery,”
said Beckie. “It has no branches sticking out
to take hold of, as a tree has.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pooh! That’s nothing. George can climb
the pole,” said his master. “Show ’em how,
George.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right, Professor,” said George, free and
easy like, and up the pole he went, like a jumping-jack
on a string.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Neddie tried it, but he slipped back, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>so did Beckie. They had not yet learned how
to stick their claws in the smooth telegraph pole,
and hold on.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m afraid you’ll never be trick bears,” said
the Professor. “I must teach you to climb a
pole. We’ll try it again to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Neddie and Beckie did not wait until next
day. All of a sudden, out from under a bush,
came the biggest skillery-scalery alligator the
bear children had ever seen. Right for Beckie
and Neddie the ’gator came, and Neddie cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come on, Beckie! Up the pole we go and
then he can’t get us!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let me go first! Let me go first!” cried
Beckie, and Neddie did, most politely. And,
before they knew it, those two bear children had
climbed the smooth telegraph pole they never
thought they could scale, and the ’gator could
not get them.</p>

<p class='c011'>What do you think of that?</p>

<p class='c011'>Then George and the Professor drove the bad
alligator away, not being the least bit afraid of
him or his tail either, for that matter, and the
man called:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You may come down now, Beckie and
Neddie. At last you have learned to climb a
pole, though it did take the alligator to make
you. You will never forget it. Come down,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>and go to sleep, and in the morning we will
travel on.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Beckie and Neddie came down the pole,
and curled up in the soft warm leaves to sleep,
glad enough that they had on thick fur coats, for
the weather was very cold. And soon they were
safe in by-low land.</p>

<p class='c011'>And now, if the church steeple doesn’t reach
up and tickle the clouds so that they giggle and
let a lot of rain fall on my umbrella, I’ll tell you
next about Neddie doing a trick.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>STORY VIII<br /> <span class='large'>NEDDIE DOES A TRICK</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Neddie and Beckie Stubtail, the little children
bears, did not sleep very well the first night they
ran away from home to become trained animals.
There were several reasons for this.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the first place they had to sleep out of
doors, and not in their own nice cave-house.
And then, too, their papa and mamma were not
with them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It—it’s lonesome,” whispered Beckie, waking
up in the dark and putting out her paw to
touch her brother. “Oh, Neddie, I wish I’d
stayed home!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush! Go to sleep!” advised Neddie,
kindly. “You’ll wake up George, the trained
bear, and the Professor man if you talk.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are they asleep?” whispered Beckie, feeling
down in the leaves to see if her doll, Mary
Ann Puddingstick Clothespin, was all right.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure they’re asleep,” answered Neddie.
“Hear ’em snore?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>And, truly enough, you could hear that bear
George snore as real as anything, honestly you
could. What? You didn’t know bears snored?
Well, did you ever sleep near one? I guess not!
So, you see, you can’t tell. But I can.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And it will soon be morning,” went on
Neddie, “and then, maybe, we’ll travel on and
on, and not have any lessons to do, and we may
get buns and popcorn.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, the trained bear did mention about
buns,” said Beckie, and then, thinking of sweet
buns and crackers she did manage to go to sleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, oh! she did miss her mamma, and Aunt
Piffy, the old bear lady, who was so fat. And
more than once Neddie wished he might wake
up and see Uncle Wigwag, even if the old bear
gentleman did play a trick on him. And as for
Mr. Whitewash, the Polar bear, Neddie would
have given a whole penny to see him again for
even a second.</p>

<p class='c011'>Still, he had run away of his own free will,
Neddie had, and he must make the best of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Besides, I like it!” he said to himself. “I’m
going to learn to be a trained bear, and, when
Beckie and I get a lot of money we’ll go back
home and make mamma and papa rich.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Neddie thought it would be very easy to do
this. In fact, he was a very kind little bear and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>had not meant to do wrong when he asked Beckie
to run away with him.</p>

<p class='c011'>But now let us see what happened.</p>

<p class='c011'>Morning came at last. The sun rose from behind
the hills, where it had slept all night, and
made a bright light through the trees, from
which all the leaves now had fallen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, children, did you sleep well?” asked
George, the trained bear, as he wet his big paws
in a spring of water and washed his face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pretty well, thank you,” answered Neddie,
politely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you think we will get some buns and
popcorn to-day, George?” asked Beckie,
anxiously.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We might,” said the trained bear. “I’m
sorry I made you think we trained bears had
that sort of food every day. But if we don’t get
it to-day I’m sure we will on Thursday, which will
be Thanksgiving. And, anyhow, to-day we’ll
travel on, and you’ll see me do my tricks, and
you’ll hear the Professor blow his bugle and sing,
and you’ll see the people standing around to
look at me and wonder. And, who knows?
perhaps you may do some tricks yourselves.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We can climb a telegraph pole, anyhow,”
said Beckie, a bit proudly. “Even if it did take
an alligator to scare us into doing it.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>“Well, we’ll have breakfast and travel on,”
said the Professor, after a bit. Then he reached
in the bag again and pulled out some more dried
bread.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Only that!” whispered Neddie, and he
thought of what a nice meal the folks at home
were having—huckleberry pancakes, maybe, with
maple sugar on, and hot buns and milk sweetened
with honey.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” sighed Beckie, but she was a
brave little bear girl and made up her mind not
to find fault, especially after having run away
when she didn’t really have to. So Beckie
washed the face of her rubber doll, Mary Ann
Puddingstick Clothespin, and made believe give
her some breakfast.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Beckie and Neddie ate their dried bread,
and so did George, the trained bear, and the
Professor ate some too. Then the Professor
played a lively tune on his bugle:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ta-ra! Ta-ra-ta! Ta-ra-ta! Ta-ra-ta! Ta!
Ta!” he blew.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was quite nice and jolly and made all the
bears feel better.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here we go!” cried the Professor. “Forward—march!
Here we go!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He tossed the long pole to George, who
shouldered it just like a gun, and marched on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>with his head high in the air, while Beckie and
Neddie laughed at him, he was so funny.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I guess we’ll like this after all,” said
Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Maybe,” spoke Beckie, as she hugged her
rubber doll.</p>

<p class='c011'>But every one was very sad back in the cave-house
where the Stubtail children lived. As
soon as morning had come Aunt Piffy, going in
to call Neddie and Beckie, saw that they were
not in their beds.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They’re gone!” cried the nice, fat old lady
bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They’re up to some trick,” said Uncle Wigwag,
who, always playing tricks himself, thought
that other bears would do the same thing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We must find them,” said Mr. Whitewash,
the polar bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>But although they looked all over they could
not find Neddie and Beckie, of course, for the
children were with the Professor and the trained
bear, far, far away. You knew that, didn’t you?</p>

<p class='c011'>Oh! how badly papa and mamma Stubtail
felt, and they called a nice dog policeman to help
find Neddie and Beckie. But I’ll tell you about
that part later. This story is about Neddie’s
trick.</p>

<p class='c011'>After breakfast, as I said, the Professor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>George, the trained bear, and Neddie and Beckie
went on and on through the woods.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Soon we will come to a village,” said the
Professor. “There George will do some of his
tricks, and you little bears can climb a telegraph
pole, or maybe the church steeple. Then the
people will laugh and clap their hands and give
us things to eat.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Buns and popcorn balls?” asked Beckie,
anxiously.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I think so,” said the Professor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Soon they did come to a village, and the Professor
blew some sweet notes on his bugle. At
once a lot of children came running out to
watch the bears, and when they saw Neddie and
Beckie the children said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, aren’t they cute!”</p>

<p class='c011'>One little girl even touched Beckie’s fur, and
Beckie liked to feel the tiny hand. Beckie and
Neddie were getting so they were not afraid of
real folks. Then George, the trained bear, did
some of his tricks, turning somersaults, playing
soldier and the like.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now you little bears will do a trick,” said
the Professor. “Come, Neddie, climb a pole!”
And he blew on the bugle.</p>

<p class='c011'>Neddie looked for a pole to climb, but just
then he saw a fat woman, almost as fat as Aunt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Piffy, coming down the street. The fat woman
had a basket of eggs on her arm, and the eggs
were very heavy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I must help her!” said Neddie, politely,
for his mamma had always taught him to be
polite to ladies, whether they were fat or not.</p>

<p class='c011'>So Neddie waltzed over to take the basket of
eggs so that he might help the woman. She saw
the bear coming and, not knowing Neddie was
kind and tame and trained, she screamed and
ran. Neddie ran after her, and just as he put
his paw on the handle of the basket of eggs he
slipped on a banana peeling, and so did the fat
lady. Down they both went, ker-thump, and the
basket of eggs fell also—and——</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, you can imagine what happened!
Neddie and the fat woman were just covered
with the whites and yellows of eggs—all stuck
up like—and everybody laughed like anything.
Really they could not help it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, what a fine trick!” cried the boys and
girls, clapping their hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, but it is too expensive a trick to do
every day,” said the Professor. “I shall have
to pay for those eggs, I guess.” And the fat
woman made him pay almost a dollar, and nobody
gave Neddie or Beckie any buns, or popcorn
balls, either.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>“Well, we’ll travel on,” said the Professor.
“We may get some ice cream in the next place.”
So on they went after Neddie had washed off the
sticky eggs from his fur in a brook of water.</p>

<p class='c011'>And next, if the rubber plant doesn’t stretch
itself out and take all the lumps of sugar from
the salt cellar, I’ll tell you about the Stubtails’
Thanksgiving.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>STORY IX<br /> <span class='large'>THE STUBTAILS’ THANKSGIVING</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Mamma! Mamma!” called little Beckie
Stubtail, the bear girl, as she awoke in the morning.
“Oh, mamma, is breakfast ready?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush!” exclaimed Neddie, the little boy
bear, as he reached over with his paw and patted
his sister Beckie. “Mamma isn’t here, Beckie.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, that’s so; she isn’t,” and Beckie sat up
in her bed of leaves under a tree out in the open
air. Neddie was sleeping next to her, and on the
other side was George, the tame trained bear, and
Professor, the man who made George do tricks,
and who blew tunes on a brass horn.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” cried Beckie. “I thought, for a
minute, just for a minute, Neddie, you know,
that we were back home again with mamma, and
papa and Aunt Piffy and Uncle Wigwag and
Mr. Whitewash, the polar bear, and all our
friends. But we’re not; are we?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” answered Neddie, stretching out in the
dried leaves, so that they rustled like corn husks.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“We’re not home, Beckie. We ran away, you
know, to become trained bears, and earn money
the way Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow, the puppy
dog boys, did when they joined the circus.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Only they didn’t,” said Beckie, looking to
see if her rubber doll, Maryann Puddingstick
Clothespin, was still asleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They didn’t what?” asked Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They didn’t earn any money. And maybe
we won’t.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, we will,” said Neddie. “You see
we know how to do the trick of climbing the telegraph
pole, and I can take a basket of eggs, and
fall down, and break almost every one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” laughed Beckie, “but that’s a trick the
Professor doesn’t want you to do. Eggs cost too
much!” and she laughed again, as she thought
of the fat lady whose basket of eggs Neddie had
tried to carry, when he slipped on a banana skin
and went down ker-thump! as I told you in another
story.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, anyhow, we’ll learn some real tricks,
and soon we’ll get money,” spoke Neddie. He
and his sister, you know, had run away from their
house in the nice cave to join George, the tame
bear, with a ring in his nose, and the Professor
who made George do tricks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wonder what we’ll have for breakfast to-day?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>asked Beckie, as she saw George, the big
bear, stretching himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope it’s something good,” spoke Neddie,
as he saw the Professor getting up. “I’m tired
of dried bread; and that’s all we’ve had so far.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; we haven’t had any of the nice buns
and the popcorn balls that George told us about
that day he met us in the woods,” went on
Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come to breakfast, Beckie and Neddie,”
called the Professor, for he could speak and
understand bear language. And he took some
dried bread out of his bag.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” exclaimed Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear, oh!” cried Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind,” said the Professor, “to-morrow
will be Thanksgiving and I’m sure something
will happen between now and then so that we
shall all have a fine dinner. We will start off
soon, and see if we can find our fortunes as Uncle
Wiggily, the rabbit gentleman, did his. Come
on!”</p>

<p class='c011'>So the little bear children, and George, the
trained bear, and the Professor ate their breakfast
of dried bread, and drank some water from
a spring. And then they traveled on again.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sometimes they would come to a little village,
or town, and there the Professor would blow his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>brass horn. All the boys and girls, and some of
the older people, would gather about in a circle.
Then George, the big bear, would do his tricks,
marching like a soldier, turning somersaults,
waltzing, climbing a tree or making believe
wrestle with the Professor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And the little bears can do tricks, too,” said
the Professor to the people. “Come, Beckie—Neddie,
climb a pole for the audience!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the little Stubtail bears would stick their
claws into a smooth telegraph pole, and up they
would go to the very tip-top.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then you should have heard the children
laugh and shout, and clap their hands. The big
people would put pennies in the hat of the Professor,
and some of the children would run in
their houses and get slices of bread, or maybe an
apple or something else good to eat to give to the
bears. For George, the big fellow, as well as
Beckie and Neddie were kind, gentle and tame
bears, you know. They would hurt no one.</p>

<p class='c011'>But when it came night they had gotten nothing
like a Thanksgiving dinner, nor did they have
any invitation to eat one with friends, either.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I—I wish we were home,” said Beckie, and
some tears came into her eyes. The tears didn’t
quite fall out, but almost.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, wait until to-morrow,” suggested
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Neddie. “Something may happen then, and
it isn’t Thanksgiving until to-morrow, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, the next day came. It was Thanksgiving,
and still there was no sign of a fine, big
dinner for the bears or the Professor. They had
slept that night in the woods, the Professor
cuddling up close to big George to keep warm in
the bear’s thick fur. And though they had some
cookies and cakes and apples to eat, it was far
from being what Beckie or Neddie would have
had, had they not run away from their cave-house.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We’ll travel on,” said the Professor, “and
see what happens.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, they had not gone very far, before all
of a sudden they saw a man running through the
woods. And right after him came a big lion,
roaring as loudly as he could roar. And the
lion was switching his tail from side to side, and
every now and then, reaching out his claws to
grab the man.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, save me! Save me!” cried the man.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bur-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r!” roared the lion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, can’t you help the poor man?” asked
Beckie, of George, the big bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll try,” said George. Then he ran after
the lion, and with the long pole which the Professor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>let George carry as a soldier-gun, George
tripped up the roaring lion beast. Just then the
Professor blew a loud blast on his brass horn,
and Beckie and Neddie threw a lot of oak tree
acorns at the lion. All this frightened the lion
very much, especially when he felt the acorns
hitting him. He thought they were bullets, and
he thought the noise of the brass horn meant that
a lot of soldiers were coming after him.</p>

<p class='c011'>So away ran the lion through the woods, and
the man was safe. Oh, how thankful he was!</p>

<p class='c011'>“You saved my life,” he said to the Professor,
and to Neddie and Beckie and George. “What
can I do for you? where are you going?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We are looking for a Thanksgiving dinner,”
said the Professor, “but we have not found it
yet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! Say no more!” cried the man, quickly.
“Come with me! I will give you the best
Thanksgiving dinner you ever ate!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who are you?” asked Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am a circus man,” answered the one the
lion had chased. “But we do not give shows in
winter. I have all my animals in a big barn, not
far away. This morning that lion would not
bring in a pail of milk when I asked him to, and
to punish him I said he could have no dinner.
So he chased me, and I don’t know what he would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>have done had he caught me. But you saved
me, the lion has run away, and I suppose a
policeman monkey will catch him. But you—come
to my animal barn and you may have the
dinner I was going to give the lion, as well as all
you can eat besides. Come on!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, at last we are to have a Thanksgiving
dinner!” cried Neddie. “Oh, joy!” And
Beckie clapped her paws.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the Professor and Beckie and Neddie
and George, the big bear, followed the circus
man. He led them to a big barn in the woods.
And, oh! all the animals that were there—elephants
and tigers and good lions, and zebras
and more bears and lots of monkeys, and giraffes
with necks so long that they could pick an orange
off a church steeple, and cunning little ponies,
and a hippopotamus with a mouth like a red
flannel bag—and hundreds of others.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Welcome to our Thanksgiving dinner!” all
the animals cried to Beckie and Neddie when
they saw the Stubtail children. “Eat all you
want!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And such a dinner as it was! From cranberry
sauce to popcorn balls and honey cakes and blueberry
pie and chestnuts and cider—and, oh, dear!
I mustn’t write any more about it or I’ll get the
indigspepsia. Anyhow it was a grand dinner,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>and in the middle of it who should come back
but the bad lion who had chased the circus man.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m—I’m sorry I was bad,” roared the lion.
“May I have a piece of pie?” Then the circus
man forgave him, and the lion had a good dinner.
And Beckie and Neddie stayed in the circus barn
all night, feeling quite happy.</p>

<p class='c011'>And I hope you have a good dinner on
Thanksgiving—each and every one of you.
But don’t eat too much. Then on the page after
this, if the fishman doesn’t blow his horn in the
phonograph and scare the player-piano, I’ll tell
you about Neddie and the elephant.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>STORY X<br /> <span class='large'>NEDDIE AND THE ELEPHANT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It was the day after Thanksgiving. Neddie
and Beckie Stubtail, the two little bear children,
awoke in the barn where the circus man kept all
his animals during winter, when he was not giving
a show in the big tent. Neddie and Beckie
felt very nice and comfortable, for they had had a
good holiday dinner when they had almost
given up expecting one; they had a nice warm
place to sleep, and they were happier than at
any time since they had run away from home to
join George, the big trained bear, and the Professor,
his master, who led George around by a
chain fast to a ring in his nose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you there, Neddie?” called Beckie from
her bed in the nice clean sawdust. She was hugging
her doll Mary Ann Puddingstick Clothespin.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course I’m here,” answered Neddie,
blinking both his eyes, and wiggling his little
short tail. “Aren’t you glad you ran away now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>with me, sister, so you can become a trained
bear?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes—I guess so,” answered Beckie. “Still,
I’d like to see my mamma, and nice fat Aunt
Piffy, just once.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, we’ll go back home pretty soon,” said
Neddie. “When we have earned some money.
Then papa and mamma will forgive us for running
away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope so,” went on Beckie. “And I hope
that Uncle Wigwag won’t play any jokes on
us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, he’s sure to do that, but we mustn’t
mind,” said Neddie, as he hopped up and shook
the sawdust out of his ears.</p>

<p class='c011'>George, the tame bear who did tricks, was
already up, and he was waltzing around to where
a lot of monkey ladies were getting breakfast for
the circus animals. Then the Professor, who led
George around by the nose when the bear did
tricks, stretched out and yawned and said to the
circus man:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was very kind of you to let us stay here
all night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pray do not mention it,” said the circus man
politely. “I hope you rested well.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, but I did not get to sleep very early,”
said the bear Professor. “I think perhaps I ate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>too much mince pie, with strawberry ice cream
on it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I didn’t sleep very good, either,” went
on Beckie. “But it was because the elephant
snored so that I was afraid he would shake the
roof down on our heads.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, you mustn’t mind that,” said the circus
man with a laugh. “Nosey, that’s the elephant’s
name, you see, really never does any harm. He’s
as gentle as a kitten and as playful as a frog.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I wouldn’t like him to jump on me,”
said Neddie with a laugh. “He’s a good bit
larger than Bully, the frog, who lives near the
beaver pond back home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then breakfast was ready, and the monkey
ladies waited on the tables at which the circus
animals sat down. And, in order that they
would not step on their own tails, the monkey
ladies tied them around their necks in a double
bow. This made them look nice, and also kept
them from catching cold in their ears.</p>

<p class='c011'>Neddie and Beckie Stubtail had a good breakfast
and they were thinking of staying with the
circus man, instead of going off looking for
adventures with George, the Professor, when the
circus man called:</p>

<p class='c011'>“All ready now! First class in somersaults!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, he sounds just like our school
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>teacher!” exclaimed Neddie. “I didn’t think
we’d have school when we left our home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“This isn’t regular school,” explained the circus
man, “but my animals have to study their
lessons, just the same. How do you think an
elephant could waltz and play a hand organ, to
say nothing of standing on a tub and wagging
his tail, if he did not have lessons and practise
them? Of course we have to have a sort of
school.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I think I’ll send Neddie and Beckie to
it,” said the Professor. “They could learn
tricks then much better than I could teach them,
and George and I would have more time to
collect pennies and buns and popcorn balls.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Would you like to go to school to me, and
learn tricks?” asked the circus man of the bear
children, and they said they would.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very well, then,” said the circus man. “As
soon as I have taught my new elephant how to
stand on his head I’ll begin, and give you a
lesson.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the new elephant, who, as yet, knew
hardly any tricks, had to get out in the middle
of the sawdust ring and learn to stand on his
head. It was not easy, either. One of the older
elephants had to show the new elephant a number
of times before he could do it even a little bit.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>But finally he could, and the circus man said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now stay standing on your head for ten
minutes, Frisko. It will be good practice for you.
Don’t get down! Stay right as you are. Now
then, second class in fast running!” and the circus
man took a lot of ponies over to one side of
the barn to have them practice for the races.</p>

<p class='c011'>And all the while, Frisko, the new elephant,
had to stand on his head. The Professor took
George, the bear, off to one side of the circus
barn to teach his pet a new trick, and as Beckie
had to wash and dress her rubber doll, Neddie
was left with nothing to do. So he walked over
and watched the new elephant learning the trick
of standing on his head.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you like it?” asked Neddie, the bear boy,
of the elephant.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, I don’t mind,” said the big creature.
“Oh, dear!” he suddenly cried. “Oh, me! Oh,
my!” and a big tear, about as large as a cup of
water, came in each of the elephant’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, what is the matter?” asked Neddie
kindly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, my back itches me something terrible!”
said Frisko, the elephant, “and I daren’t get
down from standing on my head to scratch it.
Oh, dear!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, if there is one thing worse than another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>it is to have an itchy place where you can’t
scratch it. Neddie knew this as well as anybody.
It’s as bad as wanting to sneeze when some one
scares you out of it, and really that’s the very
worst thing that can happen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, my!” went on the elephant, and he
wiggled about, and tried to scratch the itchy
place on his back, but he couldn’t, and he didn’t
dare get down from standing on his head, for
fear the circus man would be angry at him, and
oh! such a lot of trouble as he had.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Neddie thought of a plan.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How would you like to have me scratch your
back for you Frisko?” asked the little bear boy.
“I won’t dig my claws in very deep. Shall I
scratch you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you only would,” sighed the elephant. So
Neddie gently scratched the big creature who
was standing on his head. “Ah, that is lovely.
I feel so much better now,” said the elephant.
“I can stand this way as long as I have to.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But he did not have to stand on his head much
longer, for the circus man came over pretty soon
and said to Frisko:</p>

<p class='c011'>“That will do. You recited your lesson very
nicely. Now you may go to the kitchen and get
a lump of sugar.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>And the elephant did—a large lump, for he
had a large mouth, you know.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, Neddie Stubtail, I think I’ll see what
sort of lesson tricks I’ll give you to study,” went
on the circus man. “First, let me see you climb
up this pole.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a big round pole, like a telegraph
one, sticking up in the middle of the circus barn
floor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I can’t do that!” said Neddie. But then
he remembered how he and Beckie had once gone
up the telegraph pole the time the skillery-scalery
alligator was after them. Up and up went
Neddie, sticking his claws into the soft wood.
Beckie, watching her brother, felt very proud of
him, and so did George, the tame trained bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>Neddie was almost at the top, when, all of a
sudden, the pole began to tip over and over and
over.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, it’s falling!” cried Beckie. “Neddie,
look out! You’ll be hurt!”</p>

<p class='c011'>No one knew what to do. There was great
excitement. The lions roared and the tigers
snarled. Then Frisko, the elephant, who had
practiced standing on his head, and whose back
Neddie had so kindly scratched, came rushing
up, swallowing the last of his lump of sugar, and
this elephant cried:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>“Make way for me. I am strong. I can hold
up that pole until you make it fast so it will not
fall. I’ll save Neddie.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And the elephant did. In his strong trunk
he held the pole up straight until other elephants
nailed it to make it firm and steady. Then
Neddie could come safely down. The elephant
had saved him. So you see you should always
scratch an elephant’s back when you can.</p>

<p class='c011'>And now about the next story. Let me see.
I think, in case the feathers in the lady’s hat do
not tickle the milk pitcher so that it falls off the
table and spills all the cream, I’ll tell you about
Beckie and the monkey.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>STORY XI<br /> <span class='large'>BECKIE AND THE MONKEY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Many things happened to Neddie and Beckie
Stubtail, the little bear boy and girl, while they
stayed with the circus man in the barn where they
had their Thanksgiving dinner. Oh many, many
things happened, but I have only room to tell
you of a few of them.</p>

<p class='c011'>The two little bears cubs had been in the circus
barn about a week, and though they liked
it very much, and, though George, the tame
trained bear, and his master, the Professor, and
the other man, and the elephant and the lions
and tigers were all very kind to Neddie and
Beckie, they began to wish they were home.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I—I’m sort of sorry we ran away,” said
Beckie one morning, as she put a new dress
on her rubber doll, Mary Ann Puddingstick
Clothespin. It was only her own pocket handkerchief
that Beckie used for a doll’s dress, but
it did very well for all that.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I guess I’m a bit sorry, too,” said Neddie.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>“We have learned some tricks, to be sure, and I
can turn a somersault almost as good as George
can, but still it isn’t as much fun as I though it
would be.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I guess running away never is,” said Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But we have had some fun,” went on Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you mean the time you did the trick of
climbing the pole here in the barn, and it toppled
over with you and the elephant had to hold it
up?” asked Beckie. “Was that fun?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was too scared to think it was funny, but
it might have been jolly for the others,” laughed
Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the two little bear children, who had run
away from their home in the cave-house on the
side of the hill, walked around the circus barn.
They listened to the lions having their roaring
lessons, in which the seals, who juggled rubber
balls on the ends of their noses, also joined.
Then Neddie and Beckie looked at the tall
giraffes take a lesson in picking oranges off the
top rafters of the barn, and at the hippopotamus,
who had to have his sore throat looked at by Dr.
Possum, who always attended the sick circus animals.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My! You have a very sore throat,” said Dr.
Possum to the hippopotamus when he had looked
at it. The hippo opened his mouth so wide that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Dr. Possum could get right inside, which he did,
sitting on the hippo’s tongue in order to see
better. “Yes, a very sore throat,” went on Dr.
Possum. “You must gargle it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So he gave the hippo some medicine, and the
hippo gargled his throat and really he made such
a funny noise, like thunder, doing it that Beckie
and Neddie had to laugh. And that made the
hippo sneeze so that he could not gargle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When are we going out traveling around
again?” asked Neddie of the Professor and
George. “Are we always going to stay here with
the circus animals?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, indeed,” answered the Professor as he
blew a nice tune on his brass horn. “But it is
getting too cold for traveling now, and sleeping
out in the woods. Besides, all the children are
saving up their pennies for Christmas, and they
will not drop any in my cap when I go around
after George has done his tricks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So I think we will stay with the kind circus
man and his pets for some time—at least until
it gets warmer. Meanwhile, Neddie, I want to
show you a new trick that you can do with
George. I’ll have you ride on his shoulders,
carrying a broom, and I think that will make the
people laugh, and when people laugh they give
you more pennies than otherwise.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>“Oh, goodie! I’m going to learn another
trick!” cried Neddie in delight. Then the
Professor took the little bear boy off to one side
of the barn, near the place where the elephants
slept in the hay, and, with the big, kind, tame
bear, George, they practiced the new trick, the
Professor blowing a tooting-toot-toot-tune on his
brass horn every once in a while.</p>

<p class='c011'>This left Beckie to play by herself, but she
was not lonesome, for she had her rubber doll to
take care of, and she could watch the hippo
gargle his big red flannel throat, and she looked
at the monkeys doing tricks in their cages.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beckie was not very lonesome. But perhaps
if she and Neddie could have seen what was
going on back in their cave-house by the hill,
they would have run to their papa and mamma
as fast as their legs would take them, for Mr. and
Mrs. Stubtail were very lonesome for their
children. So was Aunt Piffy, the fat bear lady,
and also Uncle Wigwag and Mr. Whitewash,
the polar bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If my children do not soon come home to
me,” said Mrs. Stubtail, wiping her eyes on her
apron, “I don’t know what I shall do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know,” said Mr. Whitewash, “Uncle
Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman, and I
will start off and find them. If Uncle Wiggily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>could find his fortune he can find lost children.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is a good idea,” said Papa Stubtail.
“If Neddie and Beckie do not soon come back
I’ll get Uncle Wiggily after them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And, all this while, mind you, Neddie and
Beckie were in the circus barn.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, after Beckie had given her rubber doll
a nice wash in the parrot’s bathtub, the little bear
girl heard some one crying. At first she thought
it might be some bad animal, pretending to be
in trouble, so as to catch something for his
supper. Then Beckie remembered that she was
safe in the circus barn, where all the animals
were her friends.</p>

<p class='c011'>So she looked around, and there she saw a great
big grandfather monkey crying, and holding his
face in his paw. He was all hunched up and
stooped over as if he hadn’t a friend in the world,
and he looked very sorrowful.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, what is the matter?” asked Beckie,
kindly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have a terrible toothache,” said the monkey
gentleman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, that’s too bad!” exclaimed Beckie. She
knew what a toothache was, once having had one
herself. “Why don’t you do something for it?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>“I don’t know what to do,” said the grandfather
monkey. “That is, unless I have it pulled,
and I don’t want to do that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t blame you,” said Beckie, “still it
might be better to have it out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If they could just pull out the ache, and
leave the tooth in, I would not mind it so much,”
went on the monkey. “But when they pull the
tooth just to get out the ache—that is too much!
Oh, dear!” and he almost stood up on the end
of his tail, the pain was so bad.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beckie glanced about the circus barn. No one
seemed to be looking after the toothache monkey.
All the other monkeys were practicing on their
hand organs, and all the other animals were reciting
their different lessons. Beckie and the
old Grandfather monkey were all by themselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know what I’ll do,” said the little bear
girl. “I’ll just slip out and go to Dr. Possum’s
and get some toothache medicine for you. That
may stop your pain.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, will you?” cried the grandpa monkey.
“That will be very kind of you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Beckie left her rubber doll asleep, and
slipped out of the circus barn when no one was
looking. She hurried to Dr. Possum’s office and
got some very strong medicine. Then, when she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>went back, she put some on some cotton and then
she put the cotton in the hole of the monkey’s
tooth, and soon it was all better.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, as Beckie had nothing else to do, she
thought she would go to sleep with her doll, which
she did, lying down in the soft, clean sawdust.
Beckie slept and slept, and so she did not see the
bad old skillery-scalery alligator slip in through
the barn door which she had left open when she
came in with the toothache medicine.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nearer and nearer came the ’gator to Beckie.
She did not see him, neither did Neddie nor the
circus man, nor the Professor nor George, the
big bear, or they might have driven him away.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, ha! Now I’ll get her!” whispered the
alligator to himself. “She is asleep and can’t
see me. I’ll just carry her off to my den, and
then—Ah, we shall see what will happen then!”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Beckie was not to be carried off by the
’gator. All of a sudden the grandpa monkey,
whose toothache was all better now, saw the
skillery-scalery creature.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wake up, Beckie! Wake up!” cried the
good monkey. “Get out of the way, and I’ll
attend to that alligator.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Beckie awakened, and rolled out of the way
just in time, or the alligator might have grabbed
her. Then the monkey took four pawfuls of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>sawdust and threw it in the eyes of the alligator
and down his throat and into his mouth and nose
and ears, making the ’gator sneeze forty-’leven
times. And whenever a ’gator sneezes that way
he can’t harm anybody.</p>

<p class='c011'>That’s what happened to this skillery-scalery
alligator, and away he went, taking his humpy-bumpy
tail with him. So Beckie was saved,
which shows that you should always stop a
monkey’s toothache when you can.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the bear children and the circus animals
had their supper, and there was pickled ice cream
for those who wanted it. And, in the next story,
if the baby doesn’t sit down in the peach basket
so tightly that we have to take the poker to get
her out, I’ll tell you about Neddie and Beckie
going back home.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>STORY XII<br /> <span class='large'>NEDDIE AND BECKIE GO HOME</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Neddie!” exclaimed Beckie Stubtail,
the little girl bear, as she rolled over in the clean
shavings on the floor of the barn where the circus
animals stayed during the cold winter months.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Neddie, I’ve just thought of the nicest
game we can play! Oh, it’s just too lovely for
anything!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pooh! A girl’s game!” answered Neddie,
the boy bear, as he looked under a pile of sawdust
to see if he could find popcorn ball, or maybe an
ice cream cone. Mind, I’m not saying for sure,
but maybe. Anyhow, Neddie found nothing
good to eat, so it doesn’t make any difference.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t want to play any girls’ games,” went
on Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>I don’t call Neddie very polite, myself, but
then you may think differently. Beckie looked
sort of disappointed, and her paws, in which she
was holding Mary Ann Puddingstick Clothespin,
her rubber doll, trembled a little, and Beckie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>thought sure she was going to have to use her
pocket “hankerwitch” (which is just the same
of your handkerchief) to wipe away her tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>For Beckie was lonesome, and she wanted her
mamma, and the little girl bear wished she hadn’t
run away from home with her brother to go with
the Professor and George, the big, tame, trained
bear with the ring in his nose. Yes, indeed,
Beckie was sorry she had run away.</p>

<p class='c011'>I guess Neddie was sorry, too, for, after pawing
about a bit in the sawdust, he looked at his
sister, and when he saw her lips quivering, and
that she was trying to reach for her hankerwitch
without him seeing it—then Neddie did what he
should have done at first, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, well, Beckie, maybe a girl’s game would
be nice after all. We aren’t doing much here.
Tell me about it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will,” said Beckie, and she brightened up
and smiled as well as little girl bears can smile,
and she patted her little rubber doll, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, Neddie, just as soon as Mary Ann
Puddingstick Clothespin is asleep I’ll tell you
about the trick I thought up all by myself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Neddie waited until the rubber doll should
close her eyes, and go fast, fast to sleep. It took
some time.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, isn’t that doll asleep yet?” asked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Neddie after a bit. He was anxious to know
what trick Beckie was going to tell about.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush! Yes, she’s asleep,” said the little bear
girl. “Come on, we’ll go over near where the
elephants are eating their peanuts and I’ll tell you
all about it. Will you kindly watch over Mary
Ann Puddingstick Clothespin?” asked Beckie
of the big hippopotamus.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will,” answered the river-horse, yawning
until it looked as if some one had opened a big
red flannel bag, so large was the hippo’s mouth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now for my trick,” said Beckie when she and
her little brother were over on the side of the
circus barn where the elephants lived. “I was
thinking, Neddie, that if we could get a long
plank, or board, we could put it over the back of
one of the big elephants. Then you could get
on one end of the board and I’d get on the other,
and we would see-saw and teeter-tauter up and
down, and the people who watched us would like
the trick very much.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I think that would be fine!” cried
Neddie. “Why, that isn’t a girl’s trick at all!
It’s good enough for any of the boys! We’ll do
it, and maybe we’ll get a lot of sweet buns and
some lollypops, too! Why, that’s as good a trick
as some that George does!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And George was a pretty good trick bear, too,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>let me tell you. When the Professor blew on his
brass horn, Ta-ra-ta-ra-ta-ra! George would
somersault, or peppersault, and march like a
soldier and do all things like that.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, Neddie and Beckie found a long teetery-tautery
plank in the barn, and then they asked
the kind old elephant, who had once helped
Neddie, if he would let them put it on his back
for a see-saw.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, to be sure I will,” kindly said the elephant,
and with his long rubbery, stretchy trunk
he put the plank on his own back, for it was
quite too heavy for Neddie and Beckie to lift so
high.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I wonder how we are to get up on the
plank now?” asked the little girl bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You can climb up my neck, if you don’t
scratch me too much,” said the spotted giraffe,
who was as tall as a stepladder. So Neddie
climbed up the neck of one giraffe, on one side
of the elephant, and Beckie climbed up another
giraffe on the other side, the bear children taking
care not to scratch the tall, spotted creatures.
Then the little bear cubs got on the plank over
the elephant’s back both at the same time, balancing
themselves nicely, and then they began to
teeter-tauter! Up and down they went, while
Beckie sang this song.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>“Teeter-tauter</div>
      <div class='line'>Bread and water.</div>
      <div class='line'>Up and down we go.</div>
      <div class='line'>Sometimes I am very high</div>
      <div class='line'>Then again I’m low.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Well, the bear cubs were having a fine time,
when along came the circus man and the Professor,
who owned George, the trained bear. The
two men, who could speak and understand bear,
and all other animal languages, watched Neddie
and Beckie doing the teeter-tauter trick Beckie
had thought up all by herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s pretty good,” said the circus man,
speaking bear talk, and nodding toward the two
little bears.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, indeed,” said the Professor. Then the
two of them talked for some time in their own
language, which Beckie and Neddie could not
understand very well.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beckie and Neddie felt very proud that the
circus man and the Professor should like their
trick. But a little later, when the poll-parrot
came over to them, and told them something,
they did not feel so happy. The poll-parrot
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, you don’t know what I heard! I heard
those two men talking about you two little bears.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>I can understand man talk, and talk it myself,
you see.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What did they say?” asked Neddie, sliding
down off the teeter-tauter. That let Beckie come
down suddenly with a bump, but she fell on a pile
of soft shavings, so she did not get hurt in the
least.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What did they say?” asked the parrot.
“Why I heard them say that they were going
to dress you two bears up like clowns, and make
you go down South where it’s warm weather even
if it’s winter up here. Down there the Professor
is going to take you and George and an elephant,
and make you do that see-saw trick. Oh, you’re
going to be taken away from here!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Beckie and Neddie looked at each other. They
had never thought such a thing would happen
when they did their little trick.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” cried Beckie as she thought of
going farther and farther away from her home
and her mamma. “I wish we’d never run away,
Neddie!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So do I!” exclaimed Neddie. “But I’ll not
let them send us down South! Listen, Beckie,
we must run away again, only this time we’ll run
back home!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, goodie!” cried Beckie, clapping her
paws.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“Come on—right away!” said Neddie.
“We’ll go before the Professor and the circus
man see us!”</p>

<p class='c011'>So the two little bear children slipped out of
the back door of the barn. They wished they
could kiss George, the big, kind bear, good-by,
but it was impossible—which means you can’t do
it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Oh! how fast Neddie and Beckie ran. Over
the fields and through the woods they went, until
the circus barn was left far, far behind. And
finally, just as night was coming on, the two
little children bears reached the cave in the side of
the hill where they lived, and they were safe home
again, and oh! how glad their papa and mamma
and Aunt Piffy, the fat bear lady, were to see
them. And of course Mr. Whitewash, the Polar
bear, and Uncle Wigwag, the trick-playing bear,
were glad also. And oh! such a good supper as
Neddie and Beckie had.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We’re never going to run away again!” they
said.</p>

<p class='c011'>So that’s all to this story, but in the next one,
if the dog barking at the moon in our backyard
doesn’t take off his collar and tie it on my pussy
cat’s neck, I’ll tell you about Neddie Stubtail
and little Wuzzy Fuzzytail.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>STORY XIII<br /> <span class='large'>NEDDIE AND WUZZY FUZZYTAIL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Come, children, it’s time to get up!” called
Mrs. Stubtail, the bear lady, as she stood at the
foot of the stairs in the cave-house, on the side of
the green hill, one morning. “Come, Neddie!
Come, Beckie!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Up out of their beds in the soft, brown autumn
leaves jumped Neddie and Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, is that the Professor man, going to make
us do our trick of see-sawing on the elephant’s
back?” cried Beckie, rubbing her eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Or maybe it’s George, the tame bear, calling
us,” said Neddie. Then he and his sister looked
at each other, and they both laughed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, we’re in our own home!” exclaimed
Beckie, looking around.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So we are! And not in the circus barn at
all!” added Neddie, as he noticed his own room
in the cave. Then he and his sister laughed
again, jumped into their little bear suits, and
slid down the stair rail to breakfast.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p104.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>“Well, isn’t it good to be home again?” asked
Mrs. Stubtail, as she put some more corn griddle
cakes on the stove to cook.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed, it is!” said Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I guess you didn’t get any nice sweet
maple syrup honey like this when you ran away
from home, to go with the Professor man, and
George, the trick bear; did you?” asked Aunt
Piffy, the fat old lady bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed, we didn’t!” exclaimed Beckie, as
she took another cake. “And when you called us
to breakfast just now, mamma, we thought we
were back in the barn again, with all the circus
animals.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, what are we going to do to-day?”
asked Neddie, as he pushed back his chair. And,
just as he did it, Uncle Wigwag, the old gentleman
bear, who was always playing tricks on the
animal children, tipped Neddie over backward.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, my!” cried the bear boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t be frightened!” called Uncle Wigwag
with a laugh. “I’m not going to let you fall!”
And with that he caught Neddie, chair and all,
up in his big paws and gave him a bear hug; he
was so glad to see his little nephew back home
again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I know what I’m going to do,” said
Beckie, “I’m going to give my doll, Mary Ann
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Puddingstick Clothespin, a nice bath, and put a
clean dress on her.” For, you see, the rubber
doll had got rather mussed up traveling around
through the woods.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know what you are both going to do,” said
Mrs. Stubtail, with a smile. “You are both
going to school. You have missed enough lessons
as it is, running off the way you did.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll not punish you, although you did give us
a bad fright, but you really must go back to
school.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” exclaimed Neddie, scratching his
nose with his claws.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s what I say!” spoke Beckie. You see,
she and Neddie had been out of school nearly a
week now, and it was rather hard to go back
again.</p>

<p class='c011'>But they were pretty good little bear children—not
too goody-goody, you know, but good
enough—and so they went to school.</p>

<p class='c011'>And something happened soon after they
reached their classes. Neddie talked in school.
You see, the way it was, Joie Kat leaned over
and asked him:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where have you been all this while?”</p>

<p class='c011'>And Neddie answered back:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, in a circus. I’ll tell you all about it at
recess.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>The teacher heard them whispering, and kept
both the little bear boy and the kitten chap
in after school. Joie Kat got out first, because he
finished his punish-lesson sooner than Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>And when Neddie Stubtail finally got out of
school there was none of the other animal boys to
be seen. Every one, from Sammie Littletail, the
rabbit, to Jimmie Wibblewobble, the duck, and
Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow, the puppy dog
boys, had all run off to play.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well,” said Neddie, “I guess I’ll have to go
home alone. Never mind, maybe I’ll have an
adventure.” An adventure, you know, is something
that happens; like when you drop your
candy-penny down a crack in the boardwalk.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, Neddie was walking along through the
woods, and wishing he could find a lollypop, or
maybe some honey cakes, when, all of a sudden,
he heard a little crying voice down under a pile of
leaves. And it was such a sad, baby sort of crying
voice that Neddie was not at all frightened.
He just looked around to see who it was, thinking
perhaps it might be Jillie Longtail, the little
mousie girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>But instead he saw a big tail sticking out from
under the leaves, and when Neddie had poked
them away with his paw there he saw only Wuzzy
Fuzzytail, the tiny little fox boy.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>“Oh, hello, Wuzzy!” cried Neddie. “What
are you doing here?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I—I’m lost!” sobbed Wuzzy Fuzzytail.
“I’m lost and I don’t know where my home is—boo-hoo!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, never mind! Don’t cry!” said Neddie.
“I’ll take you home. Why did you hide under
the leaves?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well,” said Wuzzy, “when I heard you coming
along through the woods, I didn’t know who
it was. I thought maybe it was a bad bear, so I
hid under the leaves. Boo-hoo!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t cry!” said Neddie again. “I’ll take
care of you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, boo-hoo!” still sobbed Wuzzy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t say boo-hoo!” spoke Neddie. “Just
say it backward for a change—say ‘Hoo-boo!’
Maybe that will make you stop crying.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hoo-boo!” said Wuzzy Fuzzytail, the little
fox boy, and, surely enough, when he said that he
stopped crying at once.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Neddie took the paw of the little fox
boy in his own big one, and away they went
through the woods together toward the hollow log
where Wuzzy lived with his papa and mamma.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m awful glad you found me, Neddie,” said
Wuzzy Fuzzytail to the bear boy. “I wish I
could do you a favor for being so kind to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>“Oh, that’s all right!” said Neddie, sort of
careless-like. “Maybe you can, some day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, they were going along through the
woods, when, all of a sudden, they saw right in
front of them the bad old skillery-scalery
alligator.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, ha!” cried the unpleasant creature with
the hump nose, “at last I have you, Neddie Stubtail!
And a little fox, too. Better and better!
Well, I’ll take the bear first and the fox boy
afterward,” and with that he grabbed Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” cried the bear boy. “Now I am
caught. This comes of being kept in after
school.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He tried to get away from the alligator, but
could not, and he felt very sad. Poor little
Wuzzy did not know what to do, so he just
stood there shivering and wondering who would
take him home in case the alligator carried
Neddie away.</p>

<p class='c011'>But foxes are very smart, even when they are
small, and Wuzzy was a bright little chap. So,
when he saw the alligator taking Neddie away,
Wuzzy said to himself:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wonder if I can’t help him? He helped me,
so it is only fair that I should help him. What
can I do?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He thought a minute and then he said:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>“Ah, ha! I have it. I’ll bite the alligator’s tail.
He will be so surprised that he will give a jump,
and then maybe Neddie can get away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So, going softly up behind the alligator, who
did not see him, Wuzzy nipped the alligator on
the little end of his tail. And Wuzzy Fuzzytail
had very sharp teeth, let me tell you, as all foxes
have. He gave the ’gator a good, hard nip.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ouch! Wow! Horsecars and mustard
seed!” cried the alligator, and he jumped around
so suddenly, to see who was biting him, that he
let go of Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now’s your chance, Neddie! Run!” cried
Wuzzy. And how Neddie did run! Wuzzy
ran after him, and soon they were so far away
that the alligator could not catch them. Then
Neddie took Wuzzy home, and Mrs. Fuzzytail
thanked the bear boy very much and gave him a
piece of cake.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Neddie went home himself and he didn’t
whisper in school any more that day. So that’s
all to this story.</p>

<p class='c011'>And to-morrow night if the poll-parrot doesn’t
call the poodle dog funny names and bite a hole
in the firecracker, I’ll tell you about Beckie making
a doll’s dress.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>STORY XIV<br /> <span class='large'>BECKIE MAKES A DOLL’S DRESS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Beckie! Beckie, where are you?” called
Neddie Stubtail, the little boy bear, one morning
after breakfast. “Come along! You’ll be late
for school. I’m not going to wait for you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m coming,” answered Beckie from inside
the cave-house on the side of the hill. “I’m coming!
Wait a minute!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m not going to wait, and be late!” said
Neddie, and he was not quite as polite as he might
have been.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Neddie!” exclaimed Aunt Piffy, the fat
old lady bear, puffing and blowing, for she had
been down cellar after some potatoes, and when
she came up stairs she always puffed and blew.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, Neddie!” she went on, “you should
(puff) wait for (puff) your little (puff) sister.
She doesn’t very often (puff) ask you to (puff)
do it. More times she has to (puff) wait for
you!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, well, I’ll wait,” said Neddie, and he felt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>the least little bit ashamed of himself for having
talked that way to his sister. “But I don’t want
to be late,” he added.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You won’t be late—I’m coming!” called
Beckie. “I just wanted to find my needle and
thread.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Needle and thread!” cried Neddie. “You
don’t mean to tell me, do you Beckie, that you’ve
torn your dress and have to stop and sew it?
And the last bell will ring in a few minutes!
Oh, I’m not going to wait at all any longer! I’m
going!” And off the little bear boy started,
holding out his little stubby tail as stiff and
straight as he could. But at that it wasn’t much
larger than your thumb, and you could hardly
notice it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, indeed, I haven’t torn my dress, and I
don’t have to stop to sew it up,” said Beckie, as
she came running out of the cave-house. “Wait
a minute, won’t you please, Neddie? I’m just
taking my needle and thread and some pieces of
silk to school with me so I can make my new doll,
Sarah Janet Picklefeather, a new dress.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What, make your doll a dress in school?”
cried Neddie, stopping and turning around.
“Teacher never will let you, Beckie Stubtail—never!
And you know it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, but I’m not going to sew in school,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Beckie, sweetly. “I’m taking my lunch with me,
and I’m not coming home to dinner, and I’m
going to sew on my doll’s dress during the noon
recess. And I’ve got some honey cakes for my
lunch, too!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, wow!” cried Neddie. “So that’s how it
is, eh? Then I’m going to take my lunch, too,
and stay at school and have some fun. May I
have some honey cakes, mamma?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, I guess so,” answered Mrs. Stubtail,
who, with Aunt Piffy, had come to the door to
see the children start for school.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Neddie ran back to get his lunch put up.
And such a busy time as there was, for a few
minutes. Mrs. Stubtail and Aunt Piffy both
tried to put the lunch up, so Neddie would not
be late, and Mrs. Stubtail dropped the bread,
butter side down, and Aunt Piffy lost her breath
and could hardly find it again. Then Uncle
Wigwag, the bear gentleman, who was always
playing tricks, sat down in the fly paper by mistake,
and Mr. Whitewash, the polar bear gentleman,
had to pull the sticky stuff off his friend,
Uncle Wigwag.</p>

<p class='c011'>And that wasn’t all. For Mr. Whitewash
was shaving his whiskers, and when he wasn’t
looking, Mrs. Stubtail knocked over the molasses
pitcher into his cup, full of soap-suds lather, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>when Mr. Whitewash went to lather his face
again he was almost as badly stuck up as Uncle
Wigwag was with the fly paper.</p>

<p class='c011'>Oh, my! Such goings on!</p>

<p class='c011'>But, finally, Neddie’s lunch was put up and all
this while Beckie waited for him, and she never
once said “hurry up!” or “I’m going on, we’ll
be late!” Not once did she say it, though she
might well have done so, since the last bell had
been ringing for some time.</p>

<p class='c011'>But finally Beckie and Neddie got to school
and they were only about one forty-’leventh part
of a second late, and that didn’t count.</p>

<p class='c011'>I wish I could tell you all that happened in
school that day—how Neddie went to the blackboard,
and wrote a fine story of a poodle dog
that could stand on its head. And how Joie Kat
drew such a real-like picture of a mouse that
Tommie Kat, Joie’s brother, wanted to chase it,
and it was all his sister Kittie Kat could do to
stop him.</p>

<p class='c011'>But I haven’t room to tell you any of those
things now. I must tell you about Beckie making
her doll’s dress. Now, hold on, boys, if you
please. You might think this is a girl’s story,
but it isn’t—that is not all of it, even if it is partly
about a doll’s dress.</p>

<p class='c011'>If you just listen you’ll see that Beckie did a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>very brave thing, which shows you that girls can
do things as well as boys can, and lots of times
better. Take, for instance, braiding hair—a boy
couldn’t braid his hair to save him, but look how
easily a girl can do it, and chew gum, and read
a book and talk, all at the same time. Well, I
guess!</p>

<p class='c011'>Anyhow, pretty soon it was recess time, and
all the animal children could come out of school.
Some went home to their dinner, and others, who
had brought their lunch, found nice cozy places
where they could eat it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Neddie went off with Tommie and Joie Kat,
and with Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow, the puppy
dog boys. And as soon as Beckie had finished
her lunch she got out her needle and thread and
thimble and the pieces of silk, and began to make
a dress for her doll, Sarah Janet Picklefeather.</p>

<p class='c011'>First she sewed in some—tuckers, I think
they’re called, or maybe it was puckers. Anyhow,
she sewed them in the dress, Beckie did, to
make it look nice.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the little bear girl made a few frills
around the neck and down the side she sewed in
some rosettes. Around the middle she gathered
some insertions, and then on the bottom—let me
see now, what did she put on the bottom? Oh,
I know, it was a ruffle. (You boys may skip
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>this part if you like. I wouldn’t write it only I
have to put in something about the dress, or the
girls wouldn’t read the story.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Where were we? Oh, I remember. We’d
gotten to the bottom part of the dress. And that
reminds me, if we’re at the bottom of the dress
that’s all there is to it, and I can stop, and so
I’m at the end of that part, and don’t have to
write any more, thank goodness!</p>

<p class='c011'>Anyhow, Beckie was sitting on the steps of the
school, in the warm sunshine, sewing away on
Miss Picklefeather’s dress, making her needle go
in and out, when, all of a sudden, along came a
bad old, big bear who didn’t like little bear girls,
nor bear boys, either.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, ha!” growled the bad bear. “This is the
time I have caught you! I’ve been waiting a
long time to get you! Now I’m going to carry
you off to my den, and make you wash dishes for
ever and ever. Bur-r-r-r-r-r-r-r!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Beckie looked up quickly and started to run,
but she had no chance. The bad bear was right
in front of her, and the door, before which she
was sitting, was one that was hardly ever used,
so it had been locked. Beckie couldn’t escape
that way. She looked all around the school yard,
but none of her friends was in sight. Neither
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>was Neddie, who might have saved her, and as for
the teacher, she had gone home to her dinner.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, help! Help!” cried poor little Beckie.
She didn’t want the bear to take her away, and,
as for washing dishes, she just hated that work,
though she didn’t mind doing them for her
mamma.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pooh! No one will help you!” cried the bad
bear. “So don’t bother to call. Come along!”
And he reached out his paws to grab Beckie.
Then he happened to notice the doll’s dress, and,
being a very curious sort of bear, he asked:
“What are you doing?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am making a dress for my doll,” answered
Beckie, as politely as she could, with all her
trembling. Then she thought of a trick to play
on that bear. “Would you like to see me sew
on the doll’s dress?” Beckie asked, sweetly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, you might show me one or two
stitches,” said the bear, sort of careless-like.
“But, mind you, I’ll carry you off just the
same.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right,” answered Beckie. “Look closely
now. You see, I put the needle in this side of
the silk and I push it through with my thimble.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” said the bear, “I see.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now look closely,” said Beckie, and the bear
leaned forward and put his nose and eyes close
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>down. “And then,” said Beckie, “I pull my
needle out this way, and—I stick it in your soft
and tender nose—that way!” And with that she
did it, jabbing the needle into the bear’s nose!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, wow!” cried the bad bear, and he was so
surprised that he turned a back somersault and
then he ran away off in the woods to get some
honey to put on his sore nose. So he didn’t take
Beckie away after all. Which shows you that
it’s a good thing to make a doll’s dress, sometimes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, soon the other children came back to
school, and so did the teacher, and lessons went
on and everybody said Beckie was very brave.
And I think so, too, and in the story after this, if
the ashman doesn’t take our furnace out in the
yard so that it catches cold and can’t go to the
moving picture show, I’ll tell you about Neddie’s
joke on Uncle Wigwag.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>STORY XV<br /> <span class='large'>NEDDIE’S JOKE ON UNCLE WIGWAG</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“What is the matter? Why are you laughing
so much?” asked Aunt Piffy, the fat old lady
bear, of Uncle Wigwag, the comical old bear
gentleman, one morning at the breakfast table.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, ho! Ha, ha! I tee-hee—ho—ho! I just
can’t help it!” said Uncle Wigwag, giggling, so
that he spilled some honey on the tablecloth.
And Mrs. Stubtail, the mamma bear, said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, there you go again!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Excuse me!” spoke Uncle Wigwag, and
then he laughed some more, and some milk he was
drinking went down his Sunday throat, and, as
the day happened to be Thursday, it was altogether
wrong you see, and Uncle Wigwag choked
and sniffed and snuffled and laughed, all at the
same time.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I do declare!” exclaimed Aunt Piffy,
as she patted Uncle Wigwag on the back, so he
wouldn’t lose his breath. And he didn’t, I’m glad
to say, but Aunt Piffy accidentally pounded him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>so hard that she lost part of her own breath, and
when she talked next time she had to go like this:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I never (puff) saw you behave so (puff) at
the table before (puff) Waggie, in all my
(puff) life. Never! (puff). What is the (puff)
matter, Waggie?” You see she called Uncle
Wigwag by the name of Waggie for short.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh!” said Uncle Wigwag, when finally he
could talk, “I just thought of something, I did!
It made me laugh!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Whitewash, the polar bear gentleman,
looked at Uncle Wigwag quite severely, but he
said nothing, and only went on eating his breakfast.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think I know what made Uncle Wigwag
laugh,” said Beckie Stubtail, the little girl bear,
to Neddie, her brother, some time later.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What?” he asked as he looked for his books
to take to school. “What was it, Beckie?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He’s thinking of a joke to play,” said
Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe you’re right,” went on Neddie.
“Oh, Beckie, and I’ve just thought of something,
too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it?” she asked as she looked to see
if her doll, Sarah Janet Picklefeather, was nicely
covered up in the puppy dog’s basket, so she
wouldn’t get cold while Beckie was at school.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>“We’ll just play a trick on Uncle Wigwag,”
went on Neddie. “He plays so many on us that
it’s about time we played one on him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, let’s do it!” cried Beckie, clapping
her little paws. “But it won’t be a mean or an
unkind trick, will it, Neddie? For Uncle Wigwag
is very good to us, and gives us lollypops,
even if he does play a joke on us now and then.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no, it won’t be a bad trick,” said Neddie,
laughing. “Only a funny one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So the two little bear children went on to
school, talking on the way of the joke they would
play on Uncle Wigwag. In fact, Neddie was
thinking so much about this that he did not pay
enough attention to his lessons, and when the
teacher asked him: “Why does a cow eat grass?”
Neddie answered: “Because it’s a joke!”</p>

<p class='c011'>You see, he was thinking of the one he and
Beckie were going to play. But the teacher
didn’t know that, so she made Neddie go down to
the foot of the class for not answering correctly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, when school was out, Neddie and Beckie
hurried off by themselves to play the joke on
Uncle Wigwag.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you thought of what to do yet?” asked
Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” said Neddie, “you know it was cold
last night, and the little puddle of water near our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>cave-house is frozen over. It’s as slippery as
glass. Now we’ll cover the puddle over with
some sawdust, so you can’t see the ice. Then
we’ll make believe write a letter to Uncle Wigwag
and we’ll put it on the top of the sawdust in
the middle of the frozen puddle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He’ll run out to get the letter, when we tell
him there is one for him, and he’ll slip on the ice
and go down ‘ko-bunk!’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, but won’t he get hurt?” asked Beckie,
anxious-like.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, for his fur is so thick now that he won’t
feel the fall,” said Neddie. “Come on, we’ll
play the joke on him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So the two little bear children got some sawdust,
and, when no one was looking, they
sprinkled it on the ice so the slippery stuff could
not be seen.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then they made believe write a letter to Uncle
Wigwag, and, putting it in a large envelope, with
his name on the outside, they put this right in the
middle of the frozen puddle, tossing it there so
they themselves would not have to walk on the
ice and maybe fall down.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, we’ll hide behind this tree,” said
Neddie, “and watch for Uncle Wigwag to fall
down.” They had left word with Mr. Whitewash,
the polar bear, to tell Uncle Wigwag,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>as soon as he came in, that there was a letter for
him on the sawdust. Mr. Whitewash, not knowing
anything of the joke Neddie was playing,
said he would tell Uncle Wigwag of the letter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, after a while, when Neddie and Beckie
had been hiding behind the tree for some time,
out came Uncle Wigwag.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, watch!” whispered Neddie. “See
him tumble when he gets on the ice!”</p>

<p class='c011'>But, instead of going over and picking up the
letter, Uncle Wigwag put a box down on the
ground, near the path by which Neddie and
Beckie went to school, and then the old gentleman
bear himself went and hid behind a tree.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, what do you know about that!”
whispered Neddie. “He is playing a joke on
us, just as I said he would. There’s nothing in
that box but a piece of brick, or maybe a lot of
stones. Uncle Wigwag expects we’ll pick it up,
thinking it’s candy, and when we open it he’ll cry
‘April fool!’ even if it isn’t the month to play
those jokes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe that’s what he is doing,” said
Beckie, laughing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, we’ll just not be fooled,” went on
Neddie. “We’ll leave the make-believe box of
candy alone, and wait until we see Uncle Wigwag
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>go out on the ice after his letter and fall
down.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So the two little bear children, laughing to
themselves at the joke they were playing on their
fun-loving uncle, waited behind the tree. Uncle
Wigwag waited behind his tree, too.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pretty soon, along came Tommie Kat, the
kitten boy. He saw the white box on the path,
and cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, joy! I guess this is something good!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Watch him get fooled!” whispered Neddie.
But lo and behold! Tommie opened the box and
there it was filled with the nicest kind of candy!
There wasn’t a stone or brick in it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yum-yum!” cried Tommie, as he ate the
sweet stuff.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” cried Beckie. “It <i>was</i> candy,
after all. What kind of a joke do you call
that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I—I don’t know,” answered Neddie, rubbing
his nose with his paw. “I guess Uncle Wigwag
played a different one this time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then we oughtn’t to play a mean joke on
him, as long as he played such a nice candy joke
on us,” said the little bear girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I guess you’re right,” agreed Neddie.
“We’ll tell him not to go get that letter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But, before they could do this, Tommie Kat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>saw the white envelope out on the sawdust-covered
ice puddle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, joy!” he cried again. “Maybe that’s
more candy!” And, before either Beckie or
Neddie could call to him, Tommie rushed out to
get the make-believe letter. And as soon as he
got on the ice, which he couldn’t see because of
the sawdust on top, down he went ker-bunko! his
feet sliding out from under him, and the candy
scattering all over.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” cried Tommie Kat. “I’m all
sawdust! And the nice candy! Oh, dear! It’s
all lost!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Neddie and Beckie rushed out from behind
their tree.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We didn’t mean that you should fall,
Tommie,” said Neddie, as he helped the little
kitten boy to stand up. “That was for a joke
on Uncle Wigwag.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I don’t call it a very nice joke,” said
Tommie, rubbing his nose. “But, anyhow, I
did find some candy. Help me pick it up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I guess that was for us,” said Beckie. “It
was one of Uncle Wigwag’s jokes!”</p>

<p class='c011'>As the bear children and the kitten boy were
picking up the scattered sweet stuff, out came
Uncle Wigwag from behind his tree.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! Ha!” he cried to Neddie. “I guess
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>I fooled you after all, didn’t I? And so you were
going to fool me, too, eh? But Tommie got my
joke instead. Oh, dear!” and he laughed so hard
that he got the hiccoughs, and Aunt Piffy had
to rush out of the cave-house to pat him on the
back.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then, all of a sudden, the bad bear, in
whose nose Beckie had stuck the needle when she
was making her doll’s dress, came rushing up,
growling and wanting to bite some one. But
Neddie Stubtail, brave little chap that he was,
threw a hard lollypop at the bad bear, hitting him
on his sore nose, making him cry, “Wow!” and
run away off in the woods where he belonged.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the rest of the candy was picked up, and
Beckie and Neddie said they were sorry they
had tried to play the ice trick on Uncle Wigwag,
and everything was all right.</p>

<p class='c011'>And on the next page, if the penholder doesn’t
let the ink bottle fall out of the window and
make a black mark on the sidewalk, I’ll tell you
about Mr. Whitewash and the stovepipe.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>STORY XVI<br /> <span class='large'>MR. WHITEWASH AND THE STOVE PIPE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, dear!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where’s all that smoke coming from?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, ker-choo! Wuzz! Fuzz!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Snicker-snacker-snookum!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Every one seemed shouting at once.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was great excitement in the cave-house,
where the Stubtail family of bears lived. Neddie
and Beckie, the two little bear children, had
jumped out of bed and were choking and sneezing
in the hall.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, the house is filled with smoke!” cried
out Aunt Piffy, the fat old lady bear, and she
puffed so hard because her breath nearly got
away from her, that she almost slid downstairs.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is the house on fire?” asked Papa Stubtail,
as he looked around for a pail of water.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Maybe this is one of Uncle Wigwag’s
tricks,” said Beckie, as she wiped the tears out
of her eyes. She wasn’t exactly crying, you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>understand, but you know smoke always makes
tears come into your eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, no! There’s no fire!” called Mamma
Stubtail, from down in the kitchen. “I was getting
breakfast when the stovepipe suddenly fell
down. I guess you’ll have to come and fix it,
Hiram,” she called to Mr. Stubtail. His first
name was Hiram, you see.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let me do it,” said Mr. Whitewash, the polar
bear, and before any one else could hurry down
to the kitchen Mr. Whitewash had slid down the
stairs, and soon he had the stovepipe in place
again, and the stove cooked things without smoking,
and Mrs. Stubtail finished getting breakfast.</p>

<p class='c011'>But that wasn’t all about Mr. Whitewash and
the stovepipe. Just you wait until you get to
the end of the story and you’ll see.</p>

<p class='c011'>Soon breakfast was over, and Beckie and
Neddie had started for school. Then Mr. Stubtail
went to work, and Uncle Wigwag went over
to call on Uncle Wiggily Longears, the rabbit
gentleman, to talk about Christmas and Santa
Claus.</p>

<p class='c011'>That left Mr. Whitewash home with Mrs.
Stubtail, who was washing the breakfast dishes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How did the stovepipe happen to come
down?” asked Mr. Whitewash, curious-like.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I guess it’s getting old and couldn’t stand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>up much longer,” answered the lady bear. “The
first I knew it had tumbled over and the smoke
poured out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, there was lots of smoke,” said Mr.
Whitewash. “We all were frightened. I must
take a look at that pipe,” which he did, putting
on his glasses so he could see better.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha!” he cried, after a bit. “I thought so.
That stove needs a new pipe. I’ll go after it and
fix it before the children come home. Then we
won’t have any more trouble when you get up to
get the breakfast, Mrs. Stubtail.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That will be very kind of you,” said the lady
bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>So off Mr. Whitewash went to get the stovepipe.
And very nice he looked, too, walking
along through the woods and over the fields, with
his white fur all combed out like a French
poodle’s when he’s had his bath. Mr. Whitewash
was snow-white—and when he walked along
sometimes his friends took him for a snowman,
and threw snowballs at him. But Mr. Whitewash
never minded that.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, he got to the stovepipe store all right,
but the cow gentleman, who kept it, said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am very sorry, Mr. Whitewash, but we are
all out of stovepipe this morning. I expect some
in at the end of the week.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>“But I cannot wait that long,” said the white
polar bear gentleman. “Our old pipe may fall
down any day, and fill the house with smoke
again. Then the fire engines will come out and
squirt water in our cave, and there’ll be a terrible
time. I must have some stovepipe.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I’ll tell you what I’ll do,” said the cow
gentleman. “I sold some pipe to Grandfather
Goosey Gander, the duck gentleman, the other
day, and after he used it awhile he said he wanted
a different kind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So he took down that I had sold him, and
got some different kind. The old pipe is out in
his back yard now, and I think he would give it
to you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It will do no harm to ask, anyhow,” said Mr.
Whitewash.</p>

<p class='c011'>Over he went to the house of Grandfather
Goosey Gander, and there, surely enough, was
the pipe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Certainly you may have it,” said the duck
gentleman. “I am glad to give it to you. But
be careful, for it is full of black soot, and it may
get on your white coat.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I can wrap it up in a paper,” said Mr.
Whitewash, which he did. Then, taking care
not to get the stovepipe, though it was wrapped
up, against his snow-white fur, off Mr. Whitewash
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>started for the cave-house, where he lived
with the Stubtail family.</p>

<p class='c011'>Did you ever put up a stovepipe? No, I
guess you did not. Well, it is not easy work, as
Mr. Whitewash soon found. Either the pipe
he got from Grandfather Goosey Gander was
too large to fit in the chimney hole or else the
chimney hole was too small to let the pipe slide
in. Anyhow, Mr. Whitewash tried and tried
again, and once more, but the pipe would not
fit.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I guess I’ll have to get on a stepladder,” said
the polar gentleman, breathing hard.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, how black your paws are!” exclaimed
Aunt Piffy, the fat lady bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, it comes off the stovepipe,” said Mr.
Whitewash. “Please bring the stepladder.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Aunt Piffy and Mrs. Stubtail went for the
ladder, but in bringing it through the kitchen
door it slipped and caught on Mrs. Stubtail’s
paws, so that she fell down, and so did the fat
lady; and Aunt Piffy lost her breath.</p>

<p class='c011'>Aunt Piffy could hardly get her breath back
again, either, but she caught it just as it was slipping
out of the door and then she was all right
again—at least for a while.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now I guess I’ll fix this pipe!” cried Mr.
Whitewash, as he stood upon the ladder. Carefully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>he shoved the stovepipe into the chimney
hole, but still it stuck.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It must go in!” cried the polar bear gentleman,
“or else we can’t have a fire in the stove to
cook dinner.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he gave a big push on the pipe. But
something slipped. Part of what slipped was the
stepladder and the other part of what slipped
was Mr. Whitewash and the third part of it was
the stovepipe.</p>

<p class='c011'>Down they fell in a heap together on the floor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh!” screamed Aunt Piffy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, me! Oh, my!” cried Mrs. Stubtail.
“Shall I get the doctor?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Whitewash didn’t say anything for a little
while, and then he remarked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Please get me a dusting brush!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And he certainly needed it, for the soot from
the stovepipe had scattered all over him, and instead
of being a pure white bear, he was speckled
black and white now, like those dogs which always
run along under a carriage.</p>

<p class='c011'>But when Aunt Piffy and Mrs. Stubtail tried
to brush the black soot off Mr. Whitewash, they
found they were only making it worse. The
brush scattered the black all over him instead of
leaving it only in spots.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I guess you had better not try,” said Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>Whitewash. “I’ll take a bath after I get this
pipe up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can you get it up?” asked Mrs. Stubtail.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course I can,” said Mr. Whitewash.</p>

<p class='c011'>So up on the stepladder the polar bear gentleman
got again, and he tried to fix the stovepipe.
He almost had it in the chimney hole, and he was
just getting ready to holler “Hurray!” when,
all of a sudden, there was a growling noise at the
back door, and Mrs. Stubtail screamed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, a lion! Here’s a lion coming after us!”
and she and Aunt Piffy ran in the parlor and hid
under the sofa.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bur-r-r-r-r-r!” roared the lion. “I’m a bad
chap from the circus; and I’ve come after Beckie
and Neddie!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he roared again, and so loudly that he
made the stepladder tremble. This shook it so
that Mr. Whitewash, the polar bear, fell down
again. This time the stovepipe landed right on
top of his head, like the tall silk hat Uncle
Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman, wears.
And the soot from the stovepipe scattered all
over Mr. Whitewash some more until he was as
black as a piece of coal.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Get out of here!” called Mr. Whitewash to
the bad lion, and the lion was so scared at seeing a
white bear suddenly turn black, and wear a stovepipe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>for a hat, that he ran away as fast as he
could, taking his tufted tail with him. So he
didn’t get Neddie or Beckie after all, and a little
later Mr. Whitewash got the pipe all nicely fixed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he took a bath, for, oh! he was so black!
But soon he was as nice and white again as a
French poodle. So there was no more trouble
with smoke in the Stubtail cave-house, and when
Beckie and Neddie came home from school they
made molasses taffy on the stove.</p>

<p class='c011'>So that’s all I can tell you now, but on the
page after this, in case our cat doesn’t try to walk
the telephone wire and fall off into the rose bush,
I’ll tell you about Papa Stubtail in a trap.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>STORY XVII<br /> <span class='large'>PAPA STUBTAIL IN A TRAP</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Now to-night I’m going to tell you a story
about something sad that happened to Hiram
Stubtail, the papa bear. And I will not make it
any sadder than I can help. But still I have to
tell things exactly as they happened, or it would
not be fair, and we must always try to be fair and
honest in this world, no matter what happens.
Even when we’re sad we must try.</p>

<p class='c011'>But I will say this, though there is a sad part
to the story, there is also a glad part. And the
glad part I’ll put in last, so that when you go to
bed you will dream about that. I always like
to have pleasant dreams; don’t you?</p>

<p class='c011'>Once I dreamed I found a lot of money and
to make sure I’d have it when I awakened I put
it under my pillow. But when I woke up the
money was all gone. Dream money always does
that, you know. It disappears.</p>

<p class='c011'>And once I dreamed I found a lollypop, and
when I put my hand under my pillow there it was—all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>sticky! My little girl had put it there to
keep safe for the night. So that part of my
dream came true.</p>

<p class='c011'>But I started to tell you about Papa Stubtail’s
trouble, and I guess you don’t want to hear about
my troubles.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anyhow, one Saturday, when there was no
school, Beckie and Neddie Stubtail, the two little
bear children, started off to the woods to see if
they could have any fun. It was quite cold, and
it seemed as if it were going to snow, but they did
not mind that, for they had on their warm fur
coats.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know what let’s do!” exclaimed Beckie.
“Let’s go over and call on Uncle Wiggily. You
know since he found his fortune he has lots of
money, and he might give us some to get a popcorn
ball with.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right, I’ll go with you,” agreed Neddie.
So they went to the house of the old gentleman
rabbit. They found him at home, and he was
glad to see them. And, surely enough, he gave
each of the bear children a penny to buy a popcorn
ball. Bears are very fond of those sweet
things, you know.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, while Neddie and Beckie were enjoying
the popcorn balls, their papa had started to come
home from where he worked in the bed factory,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>making nice fuzzy mattresses, fluffing them up
with his sharp claws, for little bears to sleep on.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will go home a little early to-day,” said Mr.
Stubtail, to himself, “and take Neddie and
Beckie to a football game. They will enjoy
that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, as he was walking along, thinking how
funny it was for Mr. Whitewash, the polar bear
gentleman, to put up a stovepipe and get all
black—as Mr. Stubtail was thinking of this, I
say—all of a sudden he heard some one crying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Help! Help! Oh, will no one help me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! Who can that be?” exclaimed Mr.
Stubtail, looking all around, and thinking maybe
it might be one of his own children, little Neddie
or Beckie, in trouble.</p>

<p class='c011'>But he could see no one, though the voice still
cried out:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Help! Oh, please help me!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would help you if I could see you,” said Mr.
Stubtail, looking up and down and sideways and
even around the corner. Still he could see no
one, and then the voice said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here I am, right down by this board fence!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Mr. Stubtail looked more closely, and he
saw, crouched on the ground, at the bottom of a
board fence, Jollie Longtail, the little boy mousie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, there you are!” exclaimed Mr. Stubtail.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>“But why are you crying, Jollie, and why don’t
you run away?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can’t run away,” answered the mousie boy,
“because my long tail is fast through a knot hole
in the fence, and that is the reason I am crying.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your tail fast through a knot hole in the
fence?” exclaimed Mr. Stubtail. “Why, how
did that happen?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, you see,” explained Jollie. “I was
creeping along here, looking for a piece of cheese,
when my tail slipped through the hole. And,
before I knew it, another boy mousie named
Snippy-Snoopy, who doesn’t like me, came along
and tied a knot in my tail so I couldn’t pull it
back through the hole again. And here I am held
fast. Will you please untie the knot in my tail?
I can’t reach it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh course I will!” exclaimed the bear gentleman,
and very gently, so as not to hurt Jollie,
he untied the knot in the mousie boy’s tail, so
Jollie could run along home.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, thank you so much!” he called to Mr.
Stubtail, most politely. “And if ever I can do
you a favor I will!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Mr. Stubtail hurried on home, thinking
how nice it would be to take Beckie and Neddie
to the football game. And I guess Mr. Stubtail
was in such a hurry that he did not notice where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>he was going for, all of a sudden, he stepped into
a steel trap.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Snap!” it went shut, catching him on the
paw. And, oh! how it did hurt.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My goodness me! Oh, dear! This is
terrible!” cried Mr. Stubtail. “I am caught!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He tried to pull his paw out but the more he
pulled the worse it hurt, and he had to stop.
Then he tried to lift up the trap in his other paw,
thinking maybe he could carry it to the blacksmith
shop and have it filed off. But the trap
was fast to a tree by a big chain and Mr. Stubtail
could not get it loose. There he was caught fast.</p>

<p class='c011'>This is the sad part of the story. I’ll make it
just as short as I can and get to the glad part.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, poor Mr. Stubtail stood there in the trap
not knowing what to do. He thought he would
never see his home again, or his wife, or Neddie,
or Beckie, nor yet Mr. Whitewash and Aunt
Piffy and Uncle Wigwag.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” sighed Mr. Stubtail. “What
ever shall I do? Soon the hunter who put this
trap here will come along and get me. Then it
will be all up with Papa Stubtail.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But just then he heard a little rustling in the
dried leaves, and a tiny voice asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can I help you, Mr. Stubtail?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The bear gentleman looked down and saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Jollie Longtail, the mousie boy, whose tail he had
untied a little while ago.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Jollie, it’s you, is it?” asked Mr. Stubtail.
“No, I’m afraid you can’t help me. You
see, this trap and chain are made of iron, and
though you have very sharp little teeth to gnaw
through wood, you can’t gnaw iron.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” said Jollie, “I can’t do that, but maybe
I could go and get help for you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So you can!” cried Mr. Stubtail, trying not
to let the little mousie boy see how much pain
he was in. “The very thing, Jollie. Run home
and get Mr. Whitewash and Uncle Wigwag, and
any one else you can, to come and get me out of
this trap before the hunter comes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Away ran the mousie boy as fast as he could
go. But it was a long way to the cave-house—not
very far for a bear gentleman, perhaps, who
can take long steps, but quite a distance for a
little mouse chap.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I’ll get there in time!” cried Jollie. “I
must save Mr. Stubtail, for he saved me. I’ll get
there!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Faster and faster he ran on. Once a bad fox
tried to grab Jollie, but the mousie hid under a
log until the fox had passed on. Again a big
horned owl bird, with staring eyes, swooped
down on him but Jollie dodged under a stone and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>the bird stubbed its beak, and didn’t get the
mouse.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Jollie reached the cave-house and told
what had happened to Mr. Stubtail.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Stubtail was so excited that she nearly
fainted and fell into a tub of water when she
heard the news.</p>

<p class='c011'>Aunt Piffy lost her breath completely this
time, and it was several seconds before Jollie
could run after it for her and bring it back.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What!” cried Neddie, for he and Beckie had
come home. “My papa in a trap!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, and he needs help quickly!” cried Jollie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I’ll go get my uncle and Mr. Whitewash!”
said Neddie. Off he rushed to find Uncle
Wigwag and the polar bear gentleman. They
also got Uncle Wiggily, and Gup, the kind,
strong horse, and as many other animal gentlemen
as they could, and back they hurried to where
Mr. Stubtail was in the trap.</p>

<p class='c011'>Together, with the help of a kind circus
elephant, they pulled the trap open and the bear
gentleman was free. Then they all hurried away
before the hunter man, with his gun and dogs,
could get them. Mr. Stubtail limped a little
and was lame for some time, but that is better
than staying forever in a trap.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he got home his wife was out of the tub
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>of water, and she and Aunt Piffy made some nice
salve for Mr. Stubtail’s sore foot. Then they had
a lovely supper with honey ice cream, and everybody
was happy and they couldn’t do enough for
Jollie Longtail. And this is the glad part of
the story.</p>

<p class='c011'>So this shows you that you should always
untie a knot in a mousie’s tail if you can, for you
never can tell when a mousie might help you.</p>

<p class='c011'>And no more to-night, if you please, but very
soon, if the milkman’s horse doesn’t come up on
our front stoop and take our doormat to wipe
his feet on, I’ll tell you about Mamma Stubtail’s
honey cakes.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>STORY XVIII<br /> <span class='large'>MAMMA STUBTAIL’S HONEY CAKES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, mamma!” cried little Neddie Stubtail,
the bear cub, as he got ready to go to school one
morning. “What is it that smells so good in
your kitchen?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What smells so good?” spoke Mrs. Stubtail,
the mamma bear. “Well, I don’t know.
Maybe it’s the tea kettle boiling.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, mamma, you’re joking just as Uncle
Wigwag often does,” said Beckie, the little bear
girl. “I, too, smell something good. Are you
making candy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, you children just run along to school
and say your lessons,” said Mrs. Stubtail, as she
looked to see if there was any stove blacking on
her apron. But there was none, I’m glad to say.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Little bears should be seen and not heard,”
said Aunt Piffy, the fat old lady bear, as she
came up from down cellar, where she had been
looking to see if any dust had gotten in the eyes
of the potatoes.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>“Oh, but we smell something good!” cried
Neddie. “Do tell us what it is, mamma.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he and his sister Beckie sniffed and
snuffed real hard, to try and find out what it
was that smelled so good. It was like molasses
candy and popcorn and lollypops and ice cream
cones, all rolled into one. But Neddie and
Beckie could not tell exactly what it was.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anyhow, the school bell rang just then, and
they had to run on to their lessons, so they didn’t
have time to find out what it was their mamma
was cooking in the kitchen that smelled so nice.</p>

<p class='c011'>But at noontime, when they came home for
dinner, they discovered the secret. Neddie ate
up his dessert and then he blinked both his eyes
at his sister Beckie. That meant, in bear
language:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come on outside. I want to talk to you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Beckie wiggled both her ears and this
meant: “All right. I’ll be out in a minute.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And when Beckie met Neddie outside the
house and they were on their way to school,
Beckie asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it, Neddie? What smelled so
good?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s honey cakes,” said he.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Honey cakes?” exclaimed Beckie. “Why,
we don’t have them until Christmas.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>“I know,” said Neddie, “but it’s almost
Christmas now. Mamma is making a lot of
honey cakes. That’s what smelled so good this
morning. They’ll be done this afternoon and
she’ll put them out on the back steps to cool, as
she always does.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, is that all?” asked Beckie, anxious-like.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, not quite,” said Neddie. “When we
come home from school you and I will go softly
up on the back stoop and we’ll get some of the
honey cakes. They’ll be cool by then.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, but that’s not right!” cried Beckie,
“We can’t eat mamma’s honey cakes without
asking her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I didn’t say anything about eating them,”
spoke Neddie. “I just said we’d take a few
cakes in our paws. Then we’ll go to mamma and
say we saw the cakes out on the back stoop, and
we’ll ask her if we can eat them. Mind you, we
won’t take so much as a smitch of one before we
ask her!</p>

<p class='c011'>“But when she sees we have the cakes of
course she’ll let us take a nibble. Even Aunt
Piffy would do that. Otherwise we’d never get
a honey cake until Christmas. Will you do it?”
asked Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>“Oh, well; yes, I guess so,” said Beckie. “But
I’m afraid it isn’t exactly right.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, it is,” said Neddie. “Now, come on
to school, and when we come home this afternoon
we’ll get some honey cakes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But I’m afraid, after all, that what Neddie
was going to do was not exactly right. However,
let us see what happens, as the telephone
girl says.</p>

<p class='c011'>Neddie and Beckie went on to school, but they
did not do very well in their lessons, for they
were thinking so much about honey cakes. And
if they had known that Uncle Wigwag, the old
bear gentleman, who was always playing tricks,
had heard them talking about what they were
going to do, maybe they would not have felt so
happy.</p>

<p class='c011'>For Uncle Wigwag, hiding behind a stump,
had heard just what Neddie and Beckie had
planned to do to get some honey cakes. And the
old joking gentleman bear said to himself:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, I’ll play a joke on those children. It
isn’t right for them to do that, and I’ll teach
them a lesson.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So he went out on the back steps, where the
pans of honey cakes were cooling. Honey
cakes, you know, are made from honey and sugar
and other sweet things, and are very good.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>Little bear children love them more than anything
else.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let me see now. What trick shall I play?”
said Uncle Wigwag to himself. “Oh, I know.
I’ll put a lot of glue on the back steps, and make
them all sticky like fly paper. Then, when
Neddie and Beckie come up to get the honey
cakes they’ll step in the glue, and they’ll be held
fast, and they’ll make such a fuss that their
mamma and Aunt Piffy will hear them. They’ll
come out, and I guess those bear cubs will never
take any more honey cakes without asking.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Uncle Wigwag got a lot of sticky glue
from the doll factory where they glue dolls’ wigs
on, and he spread the sticky stuff all over the
back steps, where, on the top rail, Mrs. Stubtail
had set the honey cakes to cool.</p>

<p class='c011'>Oh, how delicious they smelled! Uncle Wigwag
could not help taking one, but of course that
was all right, as he paid his board to Mrs. Stubtail.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Uncle Wigwag spread out the sticky
glue, taking care not to step in it himself, and
then he went and hid behind a stump to see what
would happen when Neddie and Beckie came
softly along to get the honey cakes.</p>

<p class='c011'>But something else happened. I’ll tell you
all about it if you’ll listen.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>Neddie and Beckie hurried out of school that
afternoon. They had managed to get through
their lessons, and were very anxious to eat some
of the honey cakes—that is, if their mamma
would let them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope they’re out on the stoop when we get
there,” said Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, you honey cakes!” exclaimed Neddie,
jolly-like. “Of course they’ll be there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And just then, as it happened, there was a bad
old wolf behind the fence. And he heard what
the bear cub children were saying.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Honey cakes, eh?” exclaimed the wolf. “I
guess I’ll go get some for myself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So he ran through the woods, a shorter way
than Neddie and Beckie went, and the old wolf
got there first, just as the one did in the Little
Red Riding Hood story.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah! ha!” exclaimed the wolf, as he smelled
the honey cakes. “Now for a good meal! I’m
glad I heard Neddie and Beckie talking about
this. Oh, you honey cakes!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The old wolf went softly to the stoop. He
looked all around, but he saw no one. Mrs. Stubtail
was washing the dishes and Aunt Piffy had
gone to lie down and take a nap. Mr. Whitewash,
the polar bear, was over visiting Uncle
Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>Uncle Wigwag, as we know, was hiding behind
the stump.</p>

<p class='c011'>The wolf saw no one, and up the back steps
he went to get the honey cakes that were set out
there to cool. But something happened.</p>

<p class='c011'>All of a sudden the wolf stepped in the glue
and stuck fast. All four feet were caught in the
sticky stuff and when the wolf tried to get loose
he only stuck the faster.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, wow!” howled the wolf. “Oh, dear,
I’m caught!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wigwag, hiding behind the stump,
heard the noisy noise and, not yet having seen
the wolf, he cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, ha! Now I have caught Neddie and
Beckie. I guess this will be a lesson to them not
to take honey cakes again!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Out rushed the old gentleman bear, and when
he saw the wolf caught in the glue, instead of the
little bear cub children, Uncle Wigwag did not
know what to say, he was so surprised.</p>

<p class='c011'>And when the wolf saw the bear gentleman
he cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! Don’t bite me! I’ll be good! I’ll
not take any of your honey cakes!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’d better not,” spoke Uncle Wigwag.
And then the wolf was so frightened that he
managed to pull his feet loose from the sticky
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>glue, and away he ran without a single honey
cake.</p>

<p class='c011'>And when Neddie and Beckie came along
later to take some cakes, intending to ask if they
could eat them, they found every one so excited
at the bear cave that they didn’t take any cakes
at all. Besides, Mamma Stubtail had lifted the
honey cakes inside after the wolf made such a
racket.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But you were almost caught!” said Uncle
Wigwag to Neddie and Beckie, as he told them
what he had heard them say. Then they promised
never to think of such a thing again, and their
mamma gave them each some nice honey cakes for
supper. But the wolf had none, and it served
him right.</p>

<p class='c011'>So Uncle Wigwag played his trick just the
same, though, on a wolf instead of the bear
children. Then Aunt Piffy scrubbed all the glue
off the back steps and everybody was happy.</p>

<p class='c011'>And in the next story, if the molasses jug
doesn’t go down cellar and cry in the coal-bin so
the coal is all stuck up, I’ll tell you about Neddie
and the kindling wood.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>STORY XIX<br /> <span class='large'>NEDDIE AND THE KINDLING WOOD</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Neddie! Neddie! Where are you?” called
Mrs. Stubtail, the mamma bear, one afternoon
as she stood on the back steps, which were still
colored dark from the glue that Uncle Wigwag
had put there, the time Neddie and Beckie were
going to take the honey cakes, as I told you in
the other story. “Neddie! Neddie!” called the
mamma bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no answer for a moment, and then
Tommie, the little kitten boy, came running as
fast as he could run.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s the matter, Tommie Kat?” asked
Mrs. Stubtail. “Is a bad rat chasing you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no, not a bad rat,” answered Tommie,
as he quickly hid under an old ash can. “You
see we’re playing hide and seek, and Neddie,
he’s it. I’m hiding away from him. Don’t tell
where I am; will you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course not,” said Mrs. Stubtail, with a
laugh. “So that’s why Neddie didn’t answer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>me,” she went on. “He’s playing a game. Very
well, Tommie Kat, but when you get in homefree,
or when Neddie finds you, just tell him for
me, if you please, that I want to see him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will,” promised Tommie Kat, and then he
pulled his tail in close under the ash can so when
Neddie came to look for him he wouldn’t see
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Truly enough, in a short time, Neddie Stubtail,
the little boy bear, came looking for all the
animal children who were playing the game. He
found Jimmie Wibblewobble, the boy duck, hiding
under some corn meal sacks. Then he saw
Johnnie Bushytail, the squirrel, in a nut bag,
and Neddie saw Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow
cuddled up together behind the rain water
barrel.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Neddie could not find Tommie Kat, and
finally the little boy bear had to call out:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Givie up! Givie up! Come on in free!”</p>

<p class='c011'>This meant that when Tommie ran out from
where he was hiding Neddie would not tag him,
and the kitten boy would not be “it.” So out
Tommie came from under the ash can, and
Neddie said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, so that’s where you were; eh?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure I was,” said Tommie. “But say,
Neddie, your mamma wants you.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>“Really?” asked Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Really, truly, and truly ruly,” laughed
Tommie.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just then Mrs. Stubtail came out and called
again:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Neddie! Neddie! I want you!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it, mamma?” asked Neddie, politely,
and wondering where he would hide when it came
his turn.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I want you to bring me in some kindling
wood for the stove, so I can easily make a fire in
the morning to get breakfast,” said the bear lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, mamma, I don’t want to!” exclaimed
Neddie. “I want to play hide and seek some
more. It’s my turn to hide, and I know a dandy
place where they can’t find me. Sammie Littletail,
the rabbit, has to be it, and he’ll never find
me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, my dear little bear boy,” spoke Mrs.
Stubtail, “I know you like to play, but you must
also help me. Bringing in the wood is one of
your tasks. So don’t make a fuss about it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right, mamma, I won’t,” said Neddie,
eagerly. “Only do I have to bring in the wood
right away?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It would be better to get it in before dark,”
said Mrs. Stubtail, “but I don’t mind if you
wait a little while longer. Only don’t forget it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>and don’t be too long. It soon gets dark, you
know, and you can’t see to get me nice sticks of
wood. But go on and play a while longer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Stubtail wanted to be kind to Neddie,
but she also wished him to feel that he had certain
things to do, and must do them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, Neddie went on playing hide and seek,
and he hid in the big clothes basket that was in
the yard. He pulled a clean sheet from the line
over him, and really the basket looked as though
it were filled with clothes from the wash.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course when Sammie Littletail, the rabbit
boy, who was searching for the other animals
this time, passed by the basket, he only saw the
sheet, and never thought that Neddie was hiding
under it. So Sammie didn’t find Neddie, though
he did all the other animal boys, and such fun
as Neddie had when he ran in home free.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I told you that you couldn’t find me!” he
said, as he tried to stand on one ear, but he
couldn’t because his ear bent double. Then
Neddie fell down, and he knocked over Peetie
Bow Wow and Peetie bumped up against Jimmie
Wibblewobble, the duck, and for a time it looked
just like an animal circus.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, Neddie Stubtail was having so much fun
that he forgot all about bringing in the kindling
wood for his mamma. Then, all of a sudden it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>got dark—so dark that the animal boys couldn’t
play hide and seek any more—and Neddie remembered
the wood.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s the matter?” asked Charlie Chick,
who was also playing the game.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I forgot all about the wood,” spoke Neddie.
“You stay and help me carry it in; won’t you?
I’ll give you a honey cake, if you do, Charlie.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I’d like to very much,” said Charlie
Chick, “for I am very fond of honey cakes. But
my mamma told me to come home just as soon
as it got dark. I’ve got to help shell some yellow
corn for breakfast. Good-bye!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Charlie Chick trotted off to his chicken
coop, and all the other animal boys went to
their homes, though Neddie asked each of them
to stay and help him bring in the wood.</p>

<p class='c011'>But none of them could, for they, too, had
little things to do at home.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” sighed Neddie. “I’ve got to
bring in the kindling wood all alone. And it’s
dark! But I suppose it serves me right for letting
it go so long. Next time I’ll not.” And I
suppose it did serve Neddie right, though that
did not make it any the more pleasant.</p>

<p class='c011'>So the little bear boy went out to the woodpile.
It was so dark he could hardly see, but still he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>was brave, and he made up his mind he was not
going to ask Uncle Wigwag, or Mr. Whitewash,
the polar bear, to help him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“For it’s my own fault for not bringing in
the wood earlier,” thought Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>He hurried all he could, and brought in one
pawful, which he put in the wood-box behind the
stove. His mamma didn’t say anything when
Neddie stood there in the kitchen a minute, sort
of waiting-like, as though he hoped she would
excuse him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mamma Stubtail really felt sorry for her little
bear cub, but she knew it would be a good lesson
to him. And there are more kinds of lessons in
this world than you learn from your school books,
you know.</p>

<p class='c011'>So Neddie went out to the woodpile again,
and it was darker than ever. The little bear boy
piled his paws full of the firesticks and started
for the house. It was quite a distance, and before
Neddie got there some one stepped up behind
him and grabbed him tightly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” cried the little bear boy. “Who
is it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is I! The skillery-scalery alligator!” was
the answer, given in a shivery sort of voice. “At
last I have you! I have been waiting until it
was dark enough for me to carry you off without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>any one seeing me. Now I’ve got you.
Come along!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I’m not going!” cried Neddie, and he
struggled to get loose. But he couldn’t, for the
’gator held him too tightly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, help! help!” cried poor Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush! No more of that!” snarled the
skillery alligator, and he held one paw over
Neddie’s mouth so the little bear boy couldn’t call
for help.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come along!” cried the alligator, and he
started to drag Neddie away.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then the little bear cub thought of something.
In his paws were a lot of sharp, jagged
sticks of wood. As quickly as a flash Neddie
dropped all but one of these sticks of wood. This
one he grasped tightly in his paws, and with that
stick he gave that bad alligator such a whack on
his nose that tears came into his eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, wow! Trolley cars, and ice cream cones!
What happened to me?” cried the alligator.
“Did it thunder and lightning?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No! I did it with my little stick!” cried
Neddie and he gave the ’gator another whack,
if you will excuse my saying so. Then the
alligator cried “Wow!” again, and more tears
came into his eyes, and he could not see through
so much salt water, and then Neddie managed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>to wiggle loose and run into the house. And
the ’gator had too much of a toothache to follow,
so the little bear boy got away after all. And
the skillery-scalery alligator went to the dentist’s,
to have his tooth fixed.</p>

<p class='c011'>After that, Uncle Wigwag helped the little
bear boy bring in the rest of the wood, and never
again did Neddie let his work go until dark.
And on the next page, if the coffee grinder
doesn’t take a bite out of the gas stove and make
it sing in its sleep, I’ll tell you about Beckie and
her cough medicine.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>STORY XX<br /> <span class='large'>BECKIE AND HER COUGH MEDICINE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Ker-choo! Ker-choo! Ker-choo!” sneezed
little Beckie Stubtail, the bear girl, as she sat up
in her bed of straw one night. “Ker-choo! A-ker-choo!
Boo-hoo!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My goodness me sakes alive and some castor
oil!” cried Aunt Piffy, the nice old bear lady,
waking up from a sound sleep in the next room.
“What ever is the matter, Beckie?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! I don’t know!” cried Beckie, as
she rubbed her eyes in the dark. “But I feel so
queer! My nose is all stopped up, and I can’t
breathe and my throat tickles and I’m cold——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh my goodness!” cried Aunt Piffy, jumping
out of bed so quickly that she almost stepped
on the pussy cat’s tail.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Stubtail, the mamma bear, had also
heard her little cub girl sneezing and coughing,
and Mamma Stubtail jumped up too, and ran
to Beckie’s room, turning up the night light so
she could see what was the matter.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>“What is it, Beckie? What has happened?”
asked mamma.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! I’m so miserable,” said poor
Beckie, crying.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no wonder!” remarked Aunt Piffy.
“See, she is all uncovered, and she has taken
cold. We must put her feet in hot mustard
water at once, and send for Dr. Possum. Oh,
the dear child is going to be ill!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope not,” said Mamma Stubtail, but she
was afraid just the same.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then such a time as there was with the two
lady bears bustling around to look after Beckie.
And all through it Papa Stubtail never waked
up, for he had worked hard that day, and was a
sound sleeper. But Uncle Wigwag, the funny
old bear gentleman, did awaken, and, putting
on his dressing gown and slippers, he stuck his
head in Beckie’s room, and asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is there anything I can do?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” said Aunt Piffy. “You might heat
some water. We want to give Beckie a hot
bath.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will,” said Uncle Wigwag, and he didn’t
try to play any tricks at all then, but heated the
water at once. And Uncle Wigwag was very
fond, too, of playing tricks and jokes, let me tell
you.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>Well, soon Beckie was nice and warm, and she
had soaked her paws in mustard water, and taken
some sweet medicine. And all this while
Neddie her little bear brother, had not awakened
from his sleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Mamma Stubtail and Aunt Piffy were
kept very busy until nearly morning looking
after Beckie. Finally she did not cough or
sneeze so much, and she fell asleep. Everybody
was glad.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When it’s morning we’ll have Dr. Possum,”
said Mrs. Stubtail, softly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, morning came after a while, but it
always seems to come very slowly when you are
awake and waiting for it, especially if some one
is ill. And Beckie was quite ill. She seemed to
get worse all the while.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Dr. Possum came, right after breakfast,
he felt of Beckie’s paw to tell how fast her
pulse was beating. Then he made her put out
her tongue to see how red it was, and the animal
doctor gentleman said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Beckie is a pretty sick little bear girl.
But I think I can cure her. She needs some
cough medicine.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will it be bad, bitter medicine, doctor?”
asked Beckie, as she sat up in bed, with a dry-leaf
quilt wrapped around her.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>“Well, Beckie, I might as well tell you the
truth, for you would find it out anyhow as soon
as you tasted it,” said Dr. Possum. “The cough
medicine is going to be very bitter and bad. I
will not deceive you. But I can do one thing—I
can make it a pretty color.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do, please, then,” begged Beckie. “But
why is it that you doctors can’t make medicine
that is not bitter?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll tell you why, Beckie,” spoke Dr. Possum.
“You see the bad cold or other disease gets inside
you and it likes you so well it stays there, and
as long as it stays you can’t get better. So we
give bitter medicines—not to you, but to the bad
cold that’s inside you.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And when the cold sees that bad, bitter
medicine coming down your dear little red throat,
the cold says to itself:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Ha! Hum! This is no place for me! I’d
better get out!’ And out the cold goes, and then
you get better. That’s what bitter medicines are
for.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I see,” said Beckie. “Well, I’ll take it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you can make as many faces as you like
when you swallow it,” said Dr. Possum with a
laugh. Then he mixed up some bitter cough
medicine for Beckie, but he colored it pink, just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>to match the shade of the little bear girl’s hair
ribbon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There, now,” said the possum doctor gentleman.
“You can make believe it’s pink candy
syrup, Beckie.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll have to make believe very, very hard to do
that,” said Beckie, smiling the least little bit.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, Dr. Possum went away, and Beckie had
her first dose of the bitter cough medicine. It
was so bad and sour and puckery that she made a
terribly funny face when she took it. It was such
a funny, queer face that Neddie, her brother, who
was watching her take the medicine, had to laugh.
And, as he was drinking a glass of water just at
that minute, the water spilled all over him, of
course.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, Neddie,” said his mamma, “I guess
you had better go on to school. This is no place
for you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Neddie went to school, and Beckie stayed
home with her cough and the pink, bitter cough
medicine. For some time she felt quite miserable,
and then the medicine made her sleepy.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Aunt Piffy, who was taking care of
Beckie, said to herself:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, now, as long as she’s quiet, I’ll have
time to run across the street and get some sugar
from Mrs. Wibblewobble, the duck lady. I will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>make Beckie a little sugar candy to take after
her medicine.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Aunt Piffy, leaving Beckie asleep, stepped
out of the bear cave. And, as it happened, Mrs.
Stubtail had gone out, too. She went over to
Mrs. Kat’s house to see about getting a thimbleful
of thread to sew some shoe buttons on Mr.
Stubtail’s coat. That left Beckie sleeping all
alone in the house, for Neddie, her brother, had
gone to school, and Mr. Whitewash, the polar
bear, had gone out hunting after honey, and
Uncle Wigwag, the funny bear, was over calling
on Grandfather Goosey Gander, the duck gentleman.</p>

<p class='c011'>And a bad old lion, who used to work in a circus,
came along just then. Seeing the door of
the bear cave open, as Aunt Piffy had left it
when she went out, the lion said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, ha! I’m going in here! Perhaps I shall
find something good to eat!”</p>

<p class='c011'>In he went, and he saw Beckie asleep in her
bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, ha! A little bear girl!” growled the lion.
“The very thing for me! I’ll take her away with
me!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He was lifting Beckie up in his big paws, and
was just walking away with her, when the little
bear girl awoke. And she was so frightened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>at seeing the lion that she coughed and sneezed
and choked something dreadful. Oh, yes, indeed!</p>

<p class='c011'>“A-ker-choo! Ker-fooz! Ach! Hoch!
Pitzel!” sneezed Beckie. “Oh, dear!” she cried.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Keep quiet!” said the lion, rudely enough.
“Some one will hear you!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s what I want,” said Beckie. “Oh,
please let me alone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No! No!” growled the lion. Then Beckie
coughed some more, and her throat hurt her, and
she saw the bottle of pink, bitter medicine Dr.
Possum had left on her table.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, please let me take some of that pink
stuff!” begged Beckie of the lion.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, the lion had some good in him, after all,
and when he saw how much Beckie was suffering,
he handed her the bottle of cough medicine.
Beckie took some, and it stopped her cough at
once, but she made such a funny face when she
swallowed it that the lion cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! That must be fine stuff to have you
make such a funny face. I must look into this.
Yes, indeed!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Would you like some of my cough medicine?”
asked Beckie, hoping the lion would take
some. She knew what it would do to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed, I will,” the lion said; “I’ll drink the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>whole bottle full of pink stuff, and then you’ll
see what a queer face I’ll make.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So the lion tipped up the bottle of bitter, sour,
pink cough medicine and swallowed it all at once.
Of course it wasn’t meant to be taken that way—not
even by a lion—all at once.</p>

<p class='c011'>And such a face as the lion made! It was seven
different kinds of a face at once, and then the lion
howled and roared and said, “Oh, dear!” for his
throat seemed to be on fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then, without trying to bother Beckie any
more, out of the window the lion jumped, to run
off to find some ice water, so his throat wouldn’t
burn from the cough medicine.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course Beckie’s medicine was all gone, but
it did not matter, for her cold was soon better.
I don’t know whether it was from the medicine
she took, or whether the lion scared the cold away.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anyhow, Beckie got all well, and the lion didn’t
bother her again for more than a week.</p>

<p class='c011'>And, if the bag of peanuts doesn’t step on the
elephant’s toe and make him sneeze, I’ll tell you
next about Neddie and the tooting horn.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>STORY XXI<br /> <span class='large'>NEDDIE AND THE TOOTING HORN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Mamma, can’t Beckie come out and play?”
asked Neddie, the little bear boy, as he ran home
from school one afternoon. “I came home early
on purpose. It was such a nice, sunny day that
teacher said I might come out before the others,
to amuse Beckie.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That was very kind of you,” spoke Mrs.
Stubtail, “and I think I will let Beckie out a
little while. But you must look after her, and
see that she does not stay late, for it gets cold
after the sun goes down, and you know she is
hardly over her cough yet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I’ll be careful of her,” said Neddie, and
he was so glad he could take out his little sick
sister, that he stood up on the end of his short,
stubby tail.</p>

<p class='c011'>That is, Neddie tried to stand on the end of
his tail, but the truth of the matter is, my dear
little friends, that Neddie was getting to be such
a fat, heavy little chap of a bear cub that his tail
would not hold him any more.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>So over he fell, ker-thump-o! But he landed
in a pile of leaves so he was not hurt at all.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t let Beckie try that, Neddie,” said Mrs.
Stubtail, with a laugh. “She is only just out of
a sick bed, you know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I won’t!” laughed Neddie, as he picked himself
up and brushed off the leaves. You know I
told you, in the story before this one, how Beckie
had to take some pink, bitter medicine for her
cough that Dr. Possum gave her. Hold on, I
don’t mean that Dr. Possum gave her the cough—no,
he gave her the medicine to cure it. And a
bad lion got in after Beckie, and he swallowed
the whole bottle of medicine and that gave him
such a conniption fit that he was glad to leave the
little girl bear alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>So while Neddie waited outside the bear cave,
Mrs. Stubtail went inside to get Beckie ready
to take a little walk in the woods.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, it is just lovely to get out again, after
being in the house so long!” sighed Beckie, as
she walked along with her brother Neddie, holding
his paw.</p>

<p class='c011'>Neddie was as nice as could be, and he walked
slowly with his sister who had been ill, taking
good care that she did not stumble over a stick
or a stone.</p>

<p class='c011'>On and on they went, and pretty soon, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Neddie was thinking it was about time to start
for home with his sister, all of a sudden they
heard a tooting horn in the woods.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hark! what’s that?” cried Beckie, giving
a jump.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know,” answered Neddie, and he
looked all around, ready to run in case there
should be danger.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Maybe it’s a hunter and his dogs,” suggested
Beckie. “Oh, Neddie, I’m so frightened!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t be frightened, Beckie,” he said gently.
“I’ll take care of you. Maybe, after all, it’s only
the nice trained bear, George, and the professor
man who toots on his brass horn.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, but if it’s he maybe he’ll want to take us
back to the circus barn,” went on Beckie. “I
wouldn’t like that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nor I,” said Neddie. “But I don’t believe
it is. Let’s take a look.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So the two bear children looked all around, and
then they heard the tooting horn again. And
this time they saw who was blowing it. It was
a hunter man, and he had his gun and his dog
with him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quick! Jump behind this big tree!” cried
Neddie, and he helped Beckie to hide herself.
They were only just in time, too, for just then the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>hunter looked around, and he might have seen
the bear children, except for the tree.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the hunter blew his horn again, and, not
seeing anything to shoot, he whistled to his dog,
put his gun over his shoulder and slinging the
horn by his side, down the hill he went, leaving
Beckie and Neddie alone. And, oh, how happy
they were!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I’m glad that’s over,” said Beckie,
with a long breath. “We won’t come to these
woods again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I guess not,” said Neddie. “Let’s hurry
home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What kind of a horn was it that the hunter
man had?” asked Beckie, as she and her brother
took hold of paws again, and started for home.
“It wasn’t at all like the one the professor man
blew on. His was brass.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know it,” answered Neddie, “and this one
was made of birch bark, rolled up like a cornucopia
such as come on Christmas trees. Only
those are filled with candy, and this one had
nothing but air in it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I see,” said Beckie. “And can you blow on
a birch bark horn, Neddie?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can blow a little bit on that kind of a horn,”
said Neddie. “But we’d better not stop now
to try it. Let’s hurry home.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>So the two little bear children went on, over
hills and dales, and through the woods.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, whether they were not careful to take
the right path, or whether the hunter and his dog
and gun had so scared them that they didn’t know
what they were doing, I can’t begin to say. It
might have been one thing, and then, again, on the
other hand, it might have been something else.
And I don’t want to make a mistake.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anyhow, the first thing Beckie and Neddie
realized was that they were lost. They didn’t
know where they were, nor how to get home.
All they knew was that they were in the woods,
some distance from home, and night was coming
on.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” cried Beckie, when she saw that
Neddie did not know his way home. “Oh, dear
me!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t worry, sister dear,” he said. “I’ll take
care of you,” and he put his paws about her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I know you will,” said Beckie, “and
you are as kind as you can be; but, still, and with
all that, if I stay out after dark my cold may
get worse again, and I’ll have to take more of that
bitter medicine.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You can’t!” exclaimed Neddie. “The bad
lion swallowed it all for you!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, but Dr. Possum can make plenty more,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>and maybe worse than that!” cried Beckie.
“Oh, dear! Where is our home? It’s lost!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, it’s we who are lost,” said Neddie, with
a laugh. “Our house is just where it always
was.” And he giggled again. He didn’t feel
very much like laughing, you know, but he did
it to cheer up his little sister. It’s a good thing
to laugh, sometimes, even when you don’t feel
like it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, it kept getting darker and darker, and
Beckie was more and more frightened, even
though Neddie was as jolly as he could be.
Finally he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“We’ll just call for help. Mr. Whitewash,
the polar bear, or our papa, or Uncle Wigwag
might be roaming through these woods, and
they’d hear us and take us home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, then, holler as loudly as you can,” said
Beckie. “Perhaps mamma, or Aunt Piffy, is
out looking for us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So the two little bear children called as loudly
as they could. Again and again they shouted,
but only the echoes answered them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s of no use!” said Beckie, and she was
almost ready to cry, for her cough was hurting
her again. Then Neddie thought of something.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have it!” he cried. “I’ll make a tooting
horn out of birch bark, like the one the hunter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>man had. I’ll blow on the horn, and surely some
one will hear that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, goodie!” cried Beckie, clapping her
paws. Then she felt better.</p>

<p class='c011'>Neddie with his sharp claws quickly stripped
off some white birch bark from a tree. He
rolled the bark into a sort of cornucopia, large
at one end and small at the other. He put the
small end to his mouth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Toot! Toot! Toot!” went the little bear
boy on the birch bark horn. Again and again
he blew it. Finally Beckie said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hear some one coming!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Surely enough there was a sound in the bushes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come and get us!” cried Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m coming,” said a voice, and then, instead
of their papa or uncle bear, out jumped the
bad old skillery-scalery alligator.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now I have you!” he cried, snapping his
teeth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no, you haven’t!” said Neddie. And
with that he blew such a blast from the tooting
horn in the face of the ’gator that the bad creature
turned a somersault and a peppersault mixed together
and away he ran back to the drug store,
where he belonged. Then Neddie blew some
more tunes on the tooting horn, and this time
his papa, who was searching in the woods, heard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>him and came to get his little boy and girl bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>So Neddie and Beckie weren’t lost any more,
and soon they were safely home, and I’m glad
to say that Beckie’s cough got no worse. And
they had hot mush for supper with sweet molasses
on.</p>

<p class='c011'>And in the next story, if the lady downstairs
doesn’t come up and take my typewriter to get
her baby asleep with, I’ll tell you about Beckie
and the hand-organ man.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>“Beckie,” said Mrs. Stubtail, the lady bear,
as she came into the sitting-room in the cave-house
where the little cub girl was playing with
her rubber doll; “Beckie, I wonder if you are
well enough to go to the store for me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course I am, mamma,” answered Beckie.
“My cold and cough is all cured now. I can go
to school next week, I think.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope so,” said Mrs. Stubtail, “for you
have been very ill.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I told you, you know, about how Beckie had
to take some very bitter, sour medicine, and how
she fooled the bad lion with it.</p>

<p class='c011'>And, since her illness, Beckie had not been to
school. But she was better now, and that’s why
Mrs. Stubtail thought perhaps the little bear girl
could go to school.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, as long as you think you are able to be
out,” went on the mamma bear, “I’d like you to
bring me a cake of yeast. I want to bake some
bread.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>“I would go to the store for it myself,” went
on Mrs. Stubtail, “only I have to stay in the
house, since Aunt Piffy is visiting over at Mrs.
Wibblewobble’s duck pond, and I expect Mrs.
Bow Wow the dog lady might call this afternoon.
That’s why I asked you to go for the yeast,
Beckie.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, mamma, I don’t in the least mind,” said
Beckie, politely. “I think the walk will do me
good. It is a nice day, though it does look as
though it were going to snow. And I’ll take
my doll, Isabella Trolleycar Jamkitchen, along
with me. She needs the air, too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, wrap up warmly,” spoke Mrs. Stubtail,
“and don’t catch any more cold.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, and I won’t let the cold catch me!”
laughed Beckie, as she looked for her little red
jacket, hanging on the hat rack.</p>

<p class='c011'>So the little bear girl started off through the
woods to go to the store for a yeast cake for her
mamma.</p>

<p class='c011'>The store was kept by a nice, kind old pussycat
lady, and when Beckie got there the pussycat
was just drinking a saucer of warm milk.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Would you like some, my dear?” asked she
of Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you, I would,” said the little bear girl,
politely.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>So before buying her yeast cake, Beckie had
some nice, warm milk, and a molasses cookie,
which the cat lady storekeeper baked all by her
own self.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now be careful, and don’t lose your change,”
said the lady cat, as she gave the pennies to
Beckie. “And put the yeast cake in your pocket,
where it won’t fall out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will,” answered Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>Off she started for home, with the pennies and
the silver-covered yeast cake rattling about in her
pocket. Now a yeast cake, as I guess you all
know, is something to make a loaf of bread light
and fluffy. The yeast makes the bread all full
of little holes, so that the butter won’t fall off it
when you spread it on.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, Beckie was going along, thinking how
much nicer it was to be well than ill, and she was
wondering what the animal girls would say to her
when she went back to the school, when, all of a
sudden, Beckie heard some one crying behind a
clump of bushes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My goodness!” cried the little bear girl.
“That’s a man!”</p>

<p class='c011'>You see she could tell right away that it was
no animal crying.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, it’s a man!” thought Beckie, and she
got ready to run as soon as she could see which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>way to go, so as not to run into the man. For
most men, Beckie knew, would like to carry away
a little bear cub like herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Beckie heard the crying again and a
voice said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! How sad I am. Poor George has
run away and left me!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“George!” thought Beckie. “Why, that was
the name of the nice, tame, trained bear that
Neddie and I ran off to travel with some time
ago. I wonder if that man can be the Professor
who blew on the shiny, brass horn?”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Beckie peeked around the corner of the
bramble briar bush, behind which the crying man
was hiding, and she saw that he wasn’t the Professor
gentleman at all.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was a hand-organ man, with a nice fur coat,
and he was crying as hard as he could cry, that
man was.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t think he’d be cruel to me,” thought
Beckie. “Anyhow, he’s in trouble, and maybe
I can help him. Besides, hand-organ men most
always have monkeys, and if they are kind to the
monkeys they’ll probably be kind to little bear
girls. I’m going to ask him if I can help
him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Just then the hand-organ man cried again, and
said:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>“Oh, dear! Oh, George, why did you ever
run away and leave me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Oh, I forgot to tell you that the reason Beckie
knew the crying man played a hand-organ was
because there was a hand-organ standing up
against a tree near him. Only he wasn’t playing
it just then. You can’t very well play a hand-organ
and cry at the same time. At least I never
saw any one do it, though, of course, it may be
done.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is the matter, hand-organ man?” asked
Beckie, politely, making a little bow, as she
stepped in front of him. “Why do you cry, and
who is George? Was he a little bear?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no,” said the man, who could understand
bear talk, and speak it, too. “No, George was
not a bear. He was a monkey, and he used to
do lots of tricks as I played the music. But he
has run away and left me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Beckie noticed that there was no monkey
with the hand-organ, as there should have been,
by rights.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So you are crying for George; is that it?”
she asked the man who was wiping away his tears
on the back of his cap.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is just why, little bear girl,” he said.
“I have no monkey to do funny tricks when I
play the music, and, unless I have a monkey, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>people will not give me pennies. Oh, I have no
money, I can’t get any, and I am so hungry.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor hand-organ man!” exclaimed Beckie.
“Maybe I could be a monkey for you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You!” exclaimed the man. “Why, you are
too big. But I thank you just the same.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know I am a little larger than a monkey,”
said Beckie, “but I can do tricks. I learned
them from some circus animals, when my brother
Neddie and I ran away with a bear named
George. At first I thought you meant the bear
George.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, my monkey was named George, too,”
said the hand-organ man. “But let me see you
do some tricks.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Beckie danced around in the woods, and
played soldier, as she had seen the bear George
do, and she climbed a tall tree and then she stood
on her hind paws and begged like a little poodle
dog, and the man exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, that’s just fine! Now we’ll have a
little music!”</p>

<p class='c011'>So he played a jolly tune and Beckie did more
tricks. Then the man said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will you come with me for a while, little bear
girl, and do tricks for the people while I play?
In that way I may get some pennies, even if I
have no monkey.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>“Yes, I will come with you for a little while,”
said Beckie, “but I can not stay very long, for
my mamma expects me home with the yeast
cake.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Beckie went with the hand-organ man,
down to the city where he played. And such nice
tricks as the little bear girl did! The hand-organ
man said she was better than his monkey, and I
guess the boys and girls who saw Beckie climb a
telegraph pole thought so too. Anyhow, the man
got lots of pennies, which Beckie took up in his
cap, passing it around in her paws.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then it was time for her to go home, but the
hand-organ man was sorry to have her leave him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Maybe I’ll help you again some day,” said
Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope so,” said the man, and he didn’t cry
any more, for he had many pennies to buy food.
And he gave Beckie half of the pennies for her
own self. Wasn’t he good?</p>

<p class='c011'>And on the way home a bad old tiger from the
circus chased Beckie, but she threw the bright,
shining yeast cake at him, and the tiger thought
it was a bullet from a bang-bang gun, and he was
so frightened for fear he might get shot that he
ran off and left Beckie alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then she picked up the yeast cake, which was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>only bent sideways a little bit, and got safely
home with it, and it made a nice loaf of bread.</p>

<p class='c011'>And on the next page, if the wallpaper doesn’t
jump down off the ceiling and go to sleep in the
baby’s crib, I’ll tell<a id='t182'></a> you about Neddie playing the
piano.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>STORY XXIII<br /> <span class='large'>NEDDIE PLAYS THE PIANO</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Come, Neddie!” cried Mamma Stubtail, the
lady bear, one day, as she went to the door of the
cave-house and looked out in front where Neddie,
the little boy bear, was playing football. “It’s
time to practice your music lesson, Neddie.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” cried the little bear boy. “I wish
I was a player-piano!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a funny wish!” said Beckie, who was
taking her doll, Elizabeth Jane Huckleberrypie,
out for a walk.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why do you want to be a player-piano,
Neddie?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I wouldn’t have to practice my music
lesson,” said the little bear boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>However, since his mamma had called him,
Neddie started to go in. Then Tommie and Joie
Kat, the kitten boys, and Jackie and Peetie Bow
Wow, the puppy dog boys, called to him:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where you going, Neddie?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>“I have to practice my music lesson,” he
answered, and he went into the cave-house, but
he didn’t feel very happy. He sat down to the
piano, and he began to play:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Tinkle-tinkle tinkle-tink!</div>
      <div class='line'>Dum-te dum-dum dum-dum doo!</div>
      <div class='line'>Plinko-plunko smasho-bang!</div>
      <div class='line'>How I wish that I was through!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>That’s the kind of a tune Neddie had to play
for his exercise music practice lesson, and really
he didn’t do it well at all. For you see he was
anxious to go back to play football with the boy
animals.</p>

<p class='c011'>And that’s often the way it is when real boys
and girls have to practice music lessons. I wish
it were not so, for there is nothing nicer in this
world than music, and in order to play it well
you have to practice. And some day, if you take
music lessons, you’ll be glad that you did run up
and down the piano keyboard with your fingers
when you had much rather be out having games
with your friends. For it is very nice to be able
to play tunes.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Neddie didn’t think so as he sat on the
piano stool, drumming away, and looking at the
clock, every now and then to see when his time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>would be up, so that he could go out and play
with his animal friends.</p>

<p class='c011'>Finally the clock struck five and Neddie
finished his practice with a bang. It wasn’t
music at all, but he did not care.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hurray!” he cried. “Practice is over. Now
I can have some fun!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Out of doors he rushed and more than ever
he wished he were a player-piano, so that all he’d
have to do would be to jump up and down with
his feet when he wanted music. That is a good
way to make nice sounds, too, on the player-piano,
and I can play one or two pieces myself, that way.
But, oh, how I wish I could play by hand!</p>

<p class='c011'>However, Neddie’s friends were glad to see
him come out again. They played football and
nearly broke the window in Mrs. Wibblewobble’s
duck pen, so that she had to run out and call to
them:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, boys, you must go right away from
here. Play football somewhere else.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Neddie, the little bear boy, and his friends
had to move along and look for a vacant lot where
they could kick around their football without
breaking any windows.</p>

<p class='c011'>That night, when Mr. Stubtail, the bear papa,
came home, he asked Neddie:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>“Did everything go all right in school to-day?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, sir,” answered Neddie politely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And when you came home did you practice
your music lesson?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, sir,” answered Neddie, and he was glad
he had not skipped it, as he sometimes did.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very good,” said Mr. Stubtail. “Then on
Saturday afternoon I will take you and Beckie
to a nice moving picture show.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, joy!” cried Beckie, clapping her paws.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, happiness!” said Neddie, and he was
glad again that he had not missed his music
practice.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, that night, after Neddie had finished his
home school-work, he wanted to sit up a little
longer to read a fairy story. His mamma let him
do this, but when it came time for Neddie to go to
bed, he had not finished the story. So he begged:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, can’t I stay up just a little longer,
mamma?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, as he had been such a good boy, Mrs.
Stubtail said that he might, so Neddie settled
down into the deep-cushioned easy chair, and read
all about how the pink fairy turned herself into a
pumpkin and rolled down hill so the giant
couldn’t make a Jack-o’-lantern of her.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then quite a lot of things happened. Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>Kat, the mother of Tommie and Joie and Kittie
Kat, came in to call on Mrs. Stubtail. And
Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady,
came to ask Aunt Piffy what the old lady bear
did for dyspepsia when she ate cheese for supper.
And Grandfather Goosey Gander came in to
play a game of Scotch checkers with Uncle Wigwag,
while Mr. Whitewash, the Polar bear, went
out to look for a cake of ice on which to sleep, for,
he always liked things cold, you know.</p>

<p class='c011'>And there were so many things going on that
no one thought anything about Neddie. There
he sat in the big chair, reading the fairy story
until he fell asleep. Then, as it happened, all the
company went home at once and in a hurry, and
when Papa and Mamma Stubtail locked up the
cave-house, and put the cat down cellar, no one
thought that Neddie was asleep in the big chair.
His sister Beckie had gone up to bed some time
ago, and every one thought Neddie was in bed
also.</p>

<p class='c011'>So upstairs in the cave-house went all the big
folks, not knowing that Neddie was in the chair.
And there he stayed until it got real late and
dark. And, oh, so quiet was it in the house!
Why, you could have heard a pin drop, if any one
had let one fall.</p>

<p class='c011'>All of a sudden Neddie awakened. He sat up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>with a jump, and looked all around in the dark.
Of course he couldn’t see anything, for it was all
black.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, hardly knowing where he was, Neddie
rubbed his eyes with his paws, but still he could
scarcely see. Then he noticed a little light from
the street lamp outside, shining in through the
window, and he could tell where he was.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why!” he exclaimed, “I’m home, in my
own house! I fell asleep in the big chair. Huh!
I guess I’d better go up to bed!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Neddie stretched himself, and was wondering
if he could find his room in the dark, without
waking every one up, including Mr. Whitewash,
who was asleep on a cake of ice, when, all of a
sudden, Neddie heard a noise. It was right
under the window, near which he had been sleeping,
and he listened to a voice, saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now we’ll break in through the back door,
and we’ll take Neddie and Beckie and carry
them off to our den and never let them out
again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, that’s just what we’ll do,” answered
another voice, and then Neddie tiptoed to the
window, and looking out he saw two bad old
lions that had run away from a circus. They
were coming to get Neddie and Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, what shall I do?” thought Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>“Those lions can easily break into our house.
And if I call out to papa and mamma now the
lions will hear me and they’ll jump in through
the window and get me before I have a chance to
run.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, what can I do? How can I scare those
lions away?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Just then Neddie heard a tiny mousie run up
and down on the piano keys, making a little
tinkling sound. This made the little bear boy
think of something.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have it!” he whispered to himself in the
darkness. “I’ll go in to the piano, and I’ll play
the loudest bang-bang tune I know. Maybe the
lions will think it’s thunder and lightning and
guns shooting off, and they may be afraid and
run away!”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Neddie stole into the piano room and, all
of a sudden, he banged his paws down on the loud
keys as hard as he could. Then he played on the
tinkle-tinkle keys, and again on the thunder
notes. The lions, who were just going to break
into the cave-house, heard the noise. They had
never heard music in the dark night before, and
they thought it was thunder and lightning.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! wow!” cried one lion, “we’re going to be
caught in a storm! Come on home to our cave!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m with you!” growled the other lion, shivering,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>and away they ran, as frightened as could be,
because Neddie remembered enough of his music
lesson to make a thunder sound that he had
practiced several times.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I’m never going to make a fuss about
practice again,” he said. “Music is a good thing,
after all. It scares lions away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course everybody in the cave-house woke up
when Neddie played the piano, and when he told
his papa and mamma why he did it, to drive away
the lions, they said he had done just right.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then everything got quiet, and Neddie finished
his sleep in bed. And nothing more happened.
So, pretty soon, if the trolley car doesn’t run off
the track and bunk into the dishpan and make a
big dent in it, I’ll tell you about Neddie and
Beckie going to a party.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>STORY XXIV<br /> <span class='large'>NEDDIE AND BECKIE AT A PARTY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>One day, when Neddie and Beckie Stubtail,
the little boy and girl bear, came home from
school, where they had said their lessons, each one
getting a good mark for not whispering—one
day, as they ran in the house to get a honey cake,
they saw two little white envelopes lying on the
dining-room table.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hello!” exclaimed Neddie, looking at them.
“Here’s some post-office mail mamma has forgotten
to open.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll take it to her,” spoke Beckie, as she put
her school books on the sideboard; “I think she’s
in the kitchen. And while I’m out there I’ll
get the honey cakes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good!” cried Neddie, as he wiggled his little
tail. “And while you are about it, get as many
honey cakes as you can, Beckie.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will,” answered the little bear girl. Bears
are very fond of sweet cakes, you know, especially
if they have honey in them.</p>

<p class='c011'>But when Beckie took up the tiny envelopes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>she gave a little squeal of surprise, just like a
baby piggie under a gate, and she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, Neddie! These are for us—they are
letters, with our names on!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are they?” asked Neddie. “Sure enough!”
he cried as he looked. “I wonder who can be
writing to us?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The best way would be to open them and
find out,” suggested Aunt Piffy, the fat old lady
bear, as she came up from down cellar, where
she had gone to keep the apples from getting
lonesome. Oh, Aunt Piffy was the kindest old
lady bear you ever heard of. She was even kind
to the apples and potatoes, and all things like
that.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Open your letters,” she said to Neddie and
Beckie, “and then you can tell whom they’re
from.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Beckie began to tear open her envelope, but
Neddie, after looking at his for a moment, said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, ho! I know. This is a joke of Uncle
Wigwag’s! I’m not going to let him fool us!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wigwag, you know, was an old gentleman
bear who was always playing tricks, or
jokes, on Neddie and Beckie, and sometimes on
Aunt Piffy, too.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just then in came Mr. Whitewash, the Polar
bear gentleman.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>“Has anybody seen my cake of ice?” he cried.
“I can’t find it. Some one must have my cake
of ice!”</p>

<p class='c011'>You see, being a white Polar bear, from the
North Pole, Mr. Whitewash always used to sit
on a cake of ice to keep cool, and he often mislaid
it, or couldn’t find it, just as Grandma CluckCluck,
the old lady hen, used to lose her glasses.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where is my cake of ice?” asked Mr. Whitewash,
as he looked all around the bear cave-house.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, my goodness me sakes alive and some
horseradish-mustard!” cried Aunt Piffy. “I
think I put your cake of ice under the stove, to
have it out of the way while I swept, and by this
time——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, by this time it must be all melted!”
cried Mr. Whitewash, as he rushed out to the
kitchen. And, as luck would have it, just then,
through the door, came Mrs. Stubtail, the
mamma bear, and in her hand she had a plate
of honey cakes, that she had just baked. Of
course Mr. Whitewash rushed right into her, but
he didn’t mean to. Down went Mrs. Stubtail,
down went the honey cakes—down went Mr.
Whitewash, and such a mix-up you never saw
in all your life!</p>

<p class='c011'>But no one was hurt, I’m glad to say, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>some of the honey cakes were broken. But that
did not hurt them, and Neddie and Beckie picked
them up and their mamma let them eat the
pieces.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Mr. Whitewash managed to find his cake
of ice under the stove. It was not quite all
melted, but nearly. However, there was enough
left for him to sit on and keep cool, until the ice
man came with another cake.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then when everything was quiet Neddie took
up his envelope again, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look, Mr. Whitewash, Uncle Wigwag is
trying to play another joke on us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I do not think so,” answered the white
Polar bear gentleman. “He has not been in the
house in some time. He and Uncle Wiggily
Longears, the rabbit gentleman, are playing a
game of hop butterscotch on the duck pond. I
think your letters are no joke.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I’m going to open mine!” exclaimed
Beckie, and when she had done so and had read
the writing inside, she called out:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Neddie! It’s an invitation to a party!
Kittie Kat, the little pussy girl, is giving a party
and she’s asked me to come to it. Is yours an
invitation, too?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, yes, it is,” said Neddie slowly. “I
guess I’ll go.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>“Go? Of course we’ll go!” cried Beckie. “I
wonder what dress I’ll wear?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, that’s just the way with girls!” cried
Neddie. “As soon as they hear of a party they
begin thinking of dress.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pooh! I guess you boys are just as fussy
about wearing a new necktie!” said Beckie, as
she waggled her little stubby tail.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, to make a long story short, Neddie and
Beckie got ready to go to the party Kittie Kat
was to give. It took place three nights after the
invitations came out, and Neddie and Beckie, the
little bear children, each one dressed very nicely,
went on and on through the woods and over the
fields to the Kat home. It was not very far, and
there was a bright moon shining in the sky, so
they were not afraid.</p>

<p class='c011'>And I just wish you could have been to the
party, which Kittie Kat gave for all her animal
children friends. No, on second thought, perhaps,
it is just as well you were not there. The
animal children wouldn’t know you, and they
might have been frightened. But some day I’ll
take you around myself to call on them, and after
that they won’t mind you.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anyhow, everybody whom Beckie and Neddie
knew seemed to be at Kittie’s party. Her
brothers, Tommy and Joie Kat, waited on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>door and let in the guests as they came. Sammie
and Susie Littletail, the rabbit children, were
there, and Peetie and Jackie Bow Wow, the
puppy dog boys, and Lulu and Alice and Jimmie
Wibblewobble, the ducks, and oh! everybody.</p>

<p class='c011'>And such fun as they had! They played all
sorts of games, such as little bear in the corner,
hide the potato, lose the piano and find the
molasses. And whoever found the molasses
could have some of the sweet stuff on a spoon.
Neddie and Beckie liked this game the best of
all.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then there was another game. Kittie Kat
brought in an empty barrel, and in the bottom
she put a box of candy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now,” said Kittie, “whoever can reach over
in and down and get that box of candy may have
it. But, mind you, you’ve got to get it with your
paws, you can’t use a stick or a hook to pull it
up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Now the barrel was quite a deep one, and
though all the animal boys and girls tried, they
could not reach down and get the box of
candy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” sighed Beckie, “this is just the
kind of a trick Uncle Wigwag would play!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, it’s only in fun,” said Kittie Kat, with
a laugh, “and when you’ve all tried and can’t do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>it, I’ll turn the barrel upside down, the candy will
drop out and we’ll all have some.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wait! I haven’t finished yet!” called Neddie
Stubtail. “I think I can claw up that candy!”</p>

<p class='c011'>So he leaned over the edge of the barrel and
stretched his paw down in for the candy. At first
he could not get hold of the box. Farther and
farther he leaned over the edge, and his hind paws
came up off the floor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look out, Neddie! You’ll fall in!” cried
Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>And that is just what Neddie did. All of a
sudden into the barrel he went, head over paws
and everything. “Ker-bunko!” went Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>Everybody laughed when he went down inside
the barrel, and when he bobbed up again, holding
the candy in his paws, the animal children laughed
more than ever. For Neddie was all covered over
with white. He looked just like Mr. Whitewash,
the Polar bear gentleman, only smaller.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Neddie, what happened to you,” asked
Beckie, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know!” exclaimed Kittie Kat. “That
barrel had flour in it, and I didn’t dust it all out.
The white flour is all over Neddie’s fur.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And so it was, but no one minded.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t care. I got the candy anyhow,” said
Neddie as he jumped out of the barrel. Then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>he gave all the animal children some of the sweet
stuff, and when a few more games were played
it was time to go home.</p>

<p class='c011'>Neddie and Beckie went through the forest,
and when they were almost at the bear cave,
Beckie said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some one is following us through the woods.
Maybe it’s a bad lion.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bur-r-r-r-r! I hope not!” cried Neddie.
He turned around to look, and there it was, a bad
circus lion. But an instant later the lion roared
out:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, excuse me, Mr. Whitewash, I didn’t
know it was you!” and then the lion ran away.
You see he looked at the white flour still on
Neddie’s fur, and the bad lion thought he saw the
big, strong Polar bear gentleman, while it was
really only little Neddie. Then the bear children
ran safely home.</p>

<p class='c011'>So you see it was a good thing Neddie fell into
the flour barrel and got all white after all, as it
scared away the bad lion. And next, if the
horsie doesn’t jump out of his picture frame on
the wall, and run over my typewriter with the
pony cart, I’ll tell you about Neddie in the snowbank.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>STORY XXV<br /> <span class='large'>NEDDIE IN A SNOWBANK</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Mamma,” said Neddie Stubtail, the little
boy bear, as he got up from the supper table one
evening, “may I go over to Sammie Littletail’s
house to-night?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What for?” asked Mrs. Stubtail.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, we’re going to play with his magic
lantern,” answered Neddie. “We’re going to
show some funny pictures. All the boys are
going to be there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I wish I could go,” cried Beckie, the
little girl bear, as she looked to see if her green
hair ribbon had turned pink. But it had not, I
am sorry to say.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pooh! You wouldn’t want to be the only
girl there,” spoke Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, I would,” exclaimed Beckie. “I
like boys better than I do girls,” and she wasn’t
at all bashful-like as she said that. Some girls
are that way, you know.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>“Well, maybe I’ll take you some other night,”
said Neddie. “But may I go over this evening,
mamma?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I guess so,” answered the lady bear,
slowly. “But first you must study your school
lessons.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I’ll do that,” cried Neddie eagerly. “I’ll
learn my reading lesson and my number work.
I haven’t got much. I’ve just got to find out
how many apples a man would have left if he
bought two peaches for five cents and sold a
bushel of potatoes for thirteen musk melons.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a funny thing to want to know,”
laughed Beckie. “Who asked you that question?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know,” replied Neddie. “It’s in the
book, that’s all I know, and I’ve got to find the
answer for myself. I’m not sure, but I think
it’s a dozen honey cakes. Now please don’t
bother me any more, Beckie, for I’m going to
study.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I won’t bother you,” said the little girl
bear. “I’ve got to study my own lessons. And
after that I’m going to make a sky-blue-pink
dress for my new doll, Lillian Cheesecake
Clothes-basket.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Neddie hurried with his studying so that he
might go over to the house of Sammie Littletail,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>the rabbit boy, and see the magic lantern show.</p>

<p class='c011'>A magic lantern, you know, is something like
a moving picture show, only different. I guess
you’ve seen one, so I don’t need to tell you about
it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, Neddie finished his home school-work,
and I guess he did as you boys and girls may
often have done—he skipped the hard parts and
only took the easy questions, such as how to spell
dog, and cat, and rat, and apple, and cake.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Neddie put on his hat and coat, and
started to go over to Sammie Littletail’s house. It
was not a great way there through the woods.
The moon was shining brightly, just as it was the
night before, when Neddie and Beckie went to
Kittie Kat’s party, and Neddie fell into the flour
barrel, as I had the pleasure of telling you in the
story before this one.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Neddie got to Sammie Littletail’s house
he saw many of his little animal boy friends
there, and Sammie was all ready to start the
magic lantern show.</p>

<p class='c011'>And, oh! what a nice show it was! A white
sheet was tacked on the wall, and on that the
pictures were shown. There was one picture of
some little dogs in a country called Germany,
walking around on their hind legs and eating pie
with a spoon. Then there was another picture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>of a cow blowing her horns to make a nice tune
so the grasshoppers could dance.</p>

<p class='c011'>After that Sammie showed a picture of a big
lion, roaring in his loudest voice, and, so as to
make it seem more like a lion, Neddie, the little
bear boy, growled as loudly as he could, stooping
down under the table to hide himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>And when that picture was shown, and when
Neddie growled, Jilly Longtail, the little mousie
boy, was so scared that he cried right out loud:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I want to go home! I want to go home!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course, every one laughed at him, but for
all that poor little Jilly was quite frightened.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, it’s only a picture,” said Neddie, as he
crawled out from under the table, where he had
been trying to roar like a lion. “Don’t cry,
Jilly,” and he wiped away the tears of the little
mousie boy on his soft fur.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, after that more pictures were shown,
and then Mrs. Littletail, the rabbit lady, brought
out some nice sweet cakes for the animal boys,
and Susie Littletail, the rabbit girl, who was
a sister to Sammie, as I guess you know, helped
her mamma pass the cakes around to every one.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, everybody had a good time, and when it
came the hour for the boys to go home, which
was quite early, Sammie looked out of the window
and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>“Why, it’s snowing hard!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Snowing lard, did you say?” asked Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, not lard, and not butter either,”
answered Sammie, with a laugh. “I said it was
snowing hard—h-a-r-d—not soft, you know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, now I see!” cried Neddie. “Well, I’m
glad it’s snowing, for we can have some fun, making
snow men, and building forts and sliding
down hill.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m glad, too!” exclaimed Tommie Kat, the
kitten boy, “for it will soon be Christmas, and I
always like snow at Christmas.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Everybody else at the magic lantern show said
the same thing, and soon they had started for
their homes, because it kept snowing harder all
the while, and they did not want to get snowed
in.</p>

<p class='c011'>Neddie Stubtail, the little bear boy, hurried
along, kicking his paws through the snow, and
thinking what fun he would have with his sister
Beckie on their way to school next morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll get out my sled and pull Beckie,” thought
Neddie. He would do this, you see, because
Beckie could not come to the magic lantern
show.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, Neddie was walking along, and he was
putting out his tongue and letting the snowflakes
melt on it, sort of tickling himself like, when, all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>of a sudden, Neddie heard a roaring sound, and a
voice cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, ha! Now I’ve got you. You shan’t fool
me this time by covering yourself with flour and
making believe you’re a Polar bear. I’m after
you!” And out from behind a snowbank rushed
the bad old circus lion who had chased Neddie
and Beckie the night before, when they were on
their way home from the Kat party.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, my!” exclaimed Neddie. “I guess I’d
better run!” And run he did, through the snow,
as fast as he could. But the lion ran, too, and
he was almost catching up to Neddie, when, all
at once, the little bear came to the edge of a hill.</p>

<p class='c011'>He came to it so suddenly that he couldn’t stop
himself, and the first thing the little bear knew
he slid over the top of the hill. Down he fell,
right into the middle of a big bank of snow, on
the other side.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now a snowbank isn’t hard like the iron bank
in which you put your pennies, and so Neddie
wasn’t hurt the least mite, I’m glad to say.
Gracious, if he had fallen on a hard iron bank,
I don’t know what might have happened. I
guess maybe he’d have broken his toothache anyhow.
I’m not saying for sure, but maybe.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anyhow, Neddie fell “ker-flop!” into the soft
snow, and the fluffy flakes closed up over his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>head, not leaving any hole to show where he had
gone in. So that when the bad lion came to the
edge of the hill and looked down, expecting to
see the little bear boy, he couldn’t see him at all,
at all. For Neddie was hidden by the kind snowbank.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My, that’s rather queer,” said the lion, sort of
roaring to himself and scratching his nose with
his tail. “Very strange to be sure! I’m positive
that bear boy is around here somewhere. I’ll
just call and make him come out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So the lion called:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hey, you, Neddie Stubtail! Come out of
where ever you are and let me bite you!”</p>

<p class='c011'>But, of course, Neddie was too smart for that.
He just stayed hiding under the snowbank, and
finally the bad lion went away through the storm,
growling to himself and wondering what had happened
to Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Neddie stayed in the snowbank for some
time, and then finally the little bear chap began
wondering how he was ever going to get out to go
home. For the snowbank was very big.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then a funny thing happened. Neddie’s
warm breath melted a hole in the snowbank and
the little bear boy could look out just as if he
were looking through a window in a snow house.
And in the shining moonlight, for it had stopped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>snowing, he saw, a little way off, the very cave in
which he lived. Then he scratched hard with his
paws and breathed hard with his warm breath and
soon he was out of the snowbank. A little later
he was safe in his own house. And oh my! how
glad his mamma was to see him!</p>

<p class='c011'>So he had quite an adventure, which goes to
show that you can never tell what will happen
when a lion chases you. And on the next page,
if the popcorn doesn’t go bang up against the
ceiling and knock the gas light down cellar, I’ll
tell you about Neddie and Beckie helping Uncle
Wigwag.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>STORY XXVI<br /> <span class='large'>HELPING UNCLE WIGWAG</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>One day, when Neddie and Beckie Stubtail,
the little bear children, came home from school,
they saw in the dining-room Uncle Wigwag, the
funny old gentleman bear, who was always playing
jokes. And Uncle Wigwag was laughing
and chuckling, and giggling to himself, bobbing
up and down, and tickling himself on his ribs
to make himself laugh all the harder. And then
he’d sit down in a chair and hold his sides with his
paws because they ached so from his jollity.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, what in the world can be the matter
with Uncle Wigwag?” asked Beckie, dropping
her books, and hurrying toward him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Maybe he’s sick,” suggested Neddie. “I
guess I’d better run for Dr. Possum.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sick! He isn’t sick at all!” exclaimed Aunt
Piffy, the fat old lady bear. “He’s just up to
some of his tricks. If you ever joke with me
again that way,” she went on, looking at Uncle
Wigwag sort of sharp-like, “if ever you do that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>again, I’ll never give you any maple sugar on
your honey cakes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, what did he do? Tell us!” cried Neddie
and Beckie, while Uncle Wigwag laughed harder
than ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why he came home from the five-and-ten-cent
store—I guess it must have been,” explained
Aunt Piffy, “and he gave me a box to open. He
asked me if I didn’t want a new side hair comb,
and of course I did. Well, when I opened the
box out popped a green snake. I was so scared
that I ran down cellar and hid, and I nearly lost
my breath, and could hardly find it again. Oh,
dear!” and Aunt Piffy fanned herself with her
apron, she was so warm.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well,” said Uncle Wigwag, and he stopped
laughing long enough to talk. “I really didn’t
say there was a side comb in the box, Aunt Piffy.
Besides, it wasn’t really a snake, you know,” he
said, turning to Neddie and Beckie. “It was
only a snake made of paper, with a spring inside
like a jack-in-the-box.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I know,” said Neddie. “Where is it?
Let me take it, and I’ll play a joke on some of
the fellows at school.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Take it!” exclaimed Aunt Piffy. “I don’t
want to see it again. And mind you!” she said
to Uncle Wigwag, shaking her paw at him, “if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>you joke with me any more—no maple sugar on
your fried eggs for breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I’ll be good,” said the old bear gentleman.</p>

<p class='c011'>But it was very hard for Uncle Wigwag to
stop playing jokes. A little later that afternoon
he gave Beckie what she thought was a candy
egg, and when she tried to bite into it, thinking
it was nice and sweet, the egg popped open, and
a little chicken inside, made of paper and feathers,
crowed just like a rooster, and Beckie nearly
jumped out of her hair ribbon, she was so surprised.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! Ha!” laughed Uncle Wigwag.
“That was a good joke!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t think so,” said Beckie, sort of sorrowful-like.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t you? Well, maybe it wasn’t,” spoke
Uncle Wigwag. “Anyhow, here’s a penny for
you to buy some real candy.” Uncle Wigwag
was always that way—first he’d play a joke on
you and then he’d do you a kindness. He was
quite nice after all.</p>

<p class='c011'>And a little later Neddie was looking for a
pencil to write down some of his home school-work
on his paper pad.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here’s a good pencil,” said Uncle Wigwag,
taking one from his pocket. Neddie didn’t think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>anything, and started to write with the pencil.
But, as soon as he did so, it bounced out of his
paw and jumped around on the floor. For inside
it was a jumping-jack. It was a trick pencil,
you know, and Uncle Wigwag had played another
joke.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Excuse me while I laugh,” said the old
gentleman bear. And Neddie laughed, too, for
he rather liked the trick pencil.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then Uncle Wigwag played another trick.
Oh, but he was full of them that day! wasn’t he?
I guess he must have been roaming around two
or three five-and-ten-cent stores to find those
jokes.</p>

<p class='c011'>The last trick Uncle Wigwag played was on
Mr. Whitewash, the white Polar bear gentleman.
Mr. Whitewash used to have a cup of tea every
afternoon, while he sat down to read in the paper
about whether it was going to be cold or hot the
next day.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Whitewash used to sit on a cake of ice,
you know, because he liked everything cold, except
his tea, and he did not like warm weather at
all.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, he was sitting there, reading his paper,
and sort of not looking what he was doing. He
reached out his paw to take his cup of tea, with
his eyes still on the paper, and when he picked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>up the cup and started to drink from it, there was
no tea in it. Instead, Uncle Wigwag had put in
some ink, and when Mr. Whitewash, not looking
at it, started to drink it, the ink spilled all over
his white fur. It made him look like a spotted
clown in the circus.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha, ha!” laughed Uncle Wigwag. “That’s
a fine joke!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t think so,” said Mr. Whitewash.
“And you had better look out, or I’ll play a joke
on you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Uncle Wigwag felt sorry he had done
such a thing, and he helped Mr. Whitewash clean
the ink off his white fur. Neddie and Beckie
helped also. And a little later the Polar bear
gentleman said to the two children:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You just watch and see what a trick I shall
play on Uncle Wigwag.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Neddie and Beckie watched, though they
didn’t see anything for some time. But toward
dark that evening, when Neddie was bringing in
his wood to fill the box behind the kitchen stove,
he heard some one crying in the fields across the
way from the bear cave.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Help! Help! Oh, help!” called a voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, who can that be?” asked Beckie, who
was watching Neddie bring in the wood.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>“I’m sure I don’t know,” answered the little
bear boy, “but I’m going to see.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, you’d better not,” spoke Beckie.
“Maybe it’s the bad old lion.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, and maybe it’s Uncle Wiggily, the nice
rabbit gentleman. He may be in trouble,” went
on Neddie. “Come on, it isn’t far. We’ll go see.
We must help Uncle Wiggily, you know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no one else in the bear cave just then
to go to the help of whoever was calling, as Mrs.
Stubtail and Aunt Piffy had gone over to the
house of Mrs. Kat, the kitten children’s mamma,
to ask about making sugar pie. So Neddie and
Beckie had to do whatever they were going to do
all by themselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>They hurried on toward where they heard the
voice. It was still calling:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Help! Help! Oh, will no one help me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, we are coming!” answered Neddie, and
then he and Beckie ran around the corner by a
stump, and they saw, sitting there, Uncle Wigwag,
the old joking bear gentleman himself. He
did not seem to be in any trouble, and the bear
children wondered what had happened to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Help! Help!” he called.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, what is the matter?” asked Neddie.
“If you are in trouble why don’t you come away?
I see no one hurting you.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>“No, you can’t see it, but I’m in trouble just
the same,” said the bear gentleman making a
funny face. “I am frozen fast to a cake of
ice!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Frozen to a cake of ice?” said Beckie in surprise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes. It’s a trick played on me by Mr.
Whitewash, but I am not complaining about it.
It serves me right for playing so many jokes to-day,
especially the one on him with the ink.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was walking along, thinking of a new joke
to try, when I saw what I thought was a nice seat
here by this old stump. The seat had a blanket
over the top, and a sign saying:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>‘PLEASE SIT DOWN ON ME!’</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Well, of course, I sat down, and before I
knew it I was frozen fast. You see there was a
cake of ice under the blanket, and I’m sure Mr.
Whitewash put it there, just to fool me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I guess he did,” said Neddie, and he could
hardly keep from laughing, for Uncle Wigwag
looked so funny, frozen fast.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can’t you help me?” asked the bear gentleman.
“You see Mr. Whitewash can sit on a cake
of ice without freezing to it, for he is used to living
at the North Pole, but I am not. Oh, dear! I’m
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>freezing tighter and tighter. I may have to stay
here all night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no, we will help you,” said Neddie kindly.
So he and Beckie blew their warm breath on the
cake of ice, and soon it was melted enough so that
Uncle Wigwag could pull himself loose. And
very glad, indeed, he was to get up. Then along
came Mr. Whitewash saying, as he combed his
claws through his white fur:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I see my trick worked after all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” spoke Uncle Wigwag, “it did. And
it served me right. Now let’s all go and have
some hot chocolate, for I am chilled through.”
So they had the hot chocolate in the drug store,
and everybody was happy, and Uncle Wigwag
didn’t play any more tricks until the next time.</p>

<p class='c011'>And if the cat in our back yard doesn’t try to
walk across the clothes line and fall off into the
ash can, I’ll tell you next about Beckie Stubtail
and her wax doll.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>STORY XXVII<br /> <span class='large'>BECKIE AND HER WAX DOLL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Beckie Stubtail, the little girl bear, who
lived in the cave-house near the nice woods, had
more dolls than any real girl I know of, except
maybe the daughter of Santa Claus—that is if he
has any children. But, of course, Santa Claus
must have children of his own, or else how could
he love so many children that belong to other persons—always
giving them nice things at Christmas,
and all that?</p>

<p class='c011'>Oh, yes, I know, lots of folks say there isn’t
any Santa Claus at all, but you and I know
differently, don’t we? And if those persons don’t
believe it, I can show them, right on the roof of
my house, the very same chimney down which
Santa Claus comes every Christmas.</p>

<p class='c011'>That ought to make them believe, oughtn’t it
now? Well, I guess yes, and some lollypops besides!</p>

<p class='c011'>But what I started to say was that Beckie
Stubtail, the little girl bear, had more dolls of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>different sorts than any real child. Of course a
daughter of Santa Claus wouldn’t count, for she
could go to her papa’s big present-bag and take
out as many dolls as she wanted—or rocking
horses or jumping-jacks or anything else. So I
don’t mean her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Really Beckie had the mostest dolls, if you will
kindly let me use such a word, which I know isn’t
just right. Beckie had a rubber doll that would
bounce up and down when you dropped her in
the bath tub or on the floor. That doll’s name was
Sallie Ann Kissmequick.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then there was a rag doll, with shoe
buttons sewed in her face for eyes. And the
funny part about that doll was that she always
kept looking at her feet. I suppose it was on
account of the shoe buttons.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But best of all,” said Beckie, when she was
talking about her toys to Susie Littletail, the
rabbit girl, “best of all, I like my sawdust doll,
Matilda Jane Shavingstick. She is just lovely!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What funny names your dolls have,” said
Susie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, some of the names were given them by
my Uncle Wigwag. He’s always playing tricks,
and jokes, you know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know!” exclaimed Susie with a laugh, as
she remembered how Uncle Wigwag, the funny
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>old bear gentleman, had played one joke too
many a few days before and how he had frozen
himself fast to a cake of ice that Mr. Whitewash,
the Polar bear gentleman, used as an easy chair.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I like my clothespin doll, too,” went on
Beckie, for she did have a doll made of a clothespin,
with inky eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I like my wax doll best of all,” said Susie.
“My Uncle Wiggily Longears gave her to me
last Christmas. Oh, she’s such a darling! Her
cheeks are so pink and her eyes are so blue, and
she can open and shut them, too, and she can say
‘Mamma’ and ‘Papa,’ when you push on a
spring in her back.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I wish I had a wax doll!” exclaimed
Beckie, the little girl bear, sort of sad-like. “But
I don’t s’pose I’ll ever get one, even if Christmas
is coming.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, you boys needn’t go away just because
you think there’s nothing but dolls in this story.
I’m going to put in a real scary part pretty soon.
In fact, it’s coming around the corner of my typewriter
now and I’ll be up to it in a minute.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, Susie, the rabbit girl, and Beckie, the
little bear girl, talked a lot more about dolls. I
could write down what they said, but I guess you
girls know pretty much what it was, anyhow, and
as for the boys—well, I’ll just say that the two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>little animal girls kept on saying such things as,
“Oh, she’s just too sweet for anything!” “She’s
a darling!” “And she blinks her eyes so
natural!” All doll-talk, you know.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, Beckie and Susie walked on through the
woods, and pretty soon they came to a place
where there was an old hollow stump. In the
summer time a nice family of birds lived in it.
They were some relation to Dickie Chip-Chip, the
sparrow boy, but now all the birds had flown
away down South, where it was nice and warm.
For it was winter in bear-land, you know.</p>

<p class='c011'>All the while Beckie Stubtail was wishing and
wishing she had a wax doll, with real hair, and
then, all of sudden, she looked at the old hollow
stump, and, my goodness me sakes alive, and
some molasses cookies, she saw a lovely wax doll
there.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, look!” cried Beckie. “What a sweet
doll. Whose can she be?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, she’s yours, of course,” said Susie with
a smile, as she wiggled her long rabbit ears.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I only wish she was!” cried Beckie, clapping
her paws. “But how do you know?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, it’s easy enough to tell that,” answered
Susie. “That doll is yours, Beckie. It must be.
You see, I have a wax doll, so I don’t need another.
You have no wax doll and you want one.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>“Indeed I do, very much!” exclaimed Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then she is yours—take her,” went on the
little rabbit girl. “I’m sure she is meant for
you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But who could have left her here?” asked
Beckie wonderingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Susie did not know this, nor did Beckie.
But it would not surprise me the least bit if Santa
Claus himself had dropped that doll in the hollow
stump. You know he often comes around a few
days before Christmas to see how things are getting
on and to find out what boys and girls and
animal children need. So I think it’s safe to say
that Santa Claus left that doll in the hollow
stump for Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anyhow, the little bear girl clasped in her paws
the lovely wax doll, and then she and Susie looked
at her and made her open and shut her eyes, and
they felt of the soft wax in the doll’s pink cheeks,
and they were both happy, especially Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let’s go home!” exclaimed Susie. “I’ll get
my wax doll and we’ll play house.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right, we will!” said Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>So she and Susie, the little rabbit girl, started
back through the woods, Beckie carrying her new
wax doll. Well, they hadn’t gone very far before,
all of a sudden, out from behind a tree,
sprang the bad old skillery-scalery alligator, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>he popped out into the path, in front of Beckie
and Susie, and he wound his long double-jointed
tail around them so they couldn’t move and there
he had them fast.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, ha!” cried the bad old alligator, blinking
his fishy eyes, “now I have you both, and a little
baby, too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>You see the alligator thought the doll that
Beckie carried was a real baby, and honestly it
did look like one. Of course the alligator didn’t
know any better, you see.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, now I’ve got you two animal girls, and
also the baby,” went on the bad creature. “Oh,
ho! This is a lucky day for me!” and he blinked
his fishy eyes real sassy-like.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What—what are you going to do with us?”
Beckie asked, trying to be brave and not afraid.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What am I going to do with you?” repeated
the alligator. “Why, I am going to carry you off
to my cave and there I’ll keep you for a year and
a day. And after that—ha, hum—let me see.
Why, I guess I’ll keep you there forever.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! That will be terrible,” cried Susie,
as she thought she might never see her little
brother Sammie any more, nor Uncle Wiggily,
either.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Please let us go!” cried the little rabbit girl.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>“No, I will not!” growled the bad old skillery-scalery
alligator.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Susie and Beckie tried as hard as they
could to get away, but the alligator only wound
his double-jointed, stretchy, rubbery tail the more
tightly about them. Then he began to drag them
off to his dark cave, to keep them forever and a
day, and then—and then——</p>

<p class='c011'>All of a sudden something happened. Beckie
felt her new wax doll wiggling in her arms, and
the doll seemed to be trying to get away. Beckie
held the doll tightly, but the wax creature only
wiggled the more.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then all at once that doll grew up into a great
big giant lady, as tall as a tree in the woods, taller
and bigger and stronger than the old alligator,
and then that wax doll just took her two strong
arms, and with them she unwound the alligator’s
tail from about Beckie and Susie. And then the
doll lady cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“There you go, you bad creature, and don’t let
me ever catch you bothering Susie or Beckie
again!” And with that the doll lady just tossed
the alligator into one peppersault after another
over the tree tops, and away he sailed, turning
over and over through the air, and if he hasn’t
stopped he may be sailing yet for all I know
unless he has reached the moon.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>Beckie and Susie were so surprised that they
did not know what to do, but while they looked
the doll lady shrank down to her regular wax
size again, and she blinked her eyes and said
“Mamma” and “Papa” just like any phonograph
doll can do.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, what do you know about that?” cried
Beckie. “What a wonderful doll I have, to be
sure!”</p>

<p class='c011'>But that was the only time Beckie’s wax doll
turned herself into a giant lady, and she wouldn’t
have done it that time only to save Beckie and
Susie from the alligator.</p>

<p class='c011'>The two little animal girls were very glad indeed
to get away from the skillery-scalery alligator,
and they hurried home as fast as they
could, and played house with the wax doll, and
had a lot of fun.</p>

<p class='c011'>And in the next story, if the baby carriage
doesn’t fall down stairs and bump the rubber
tires off the wheels, for the puppy dog to chew for
gum, I’ll tell you about Neddie and the lemon pie.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>STORY XXVIII<br /> <span class='large'>NEDDIE AND THE LEMON PIE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Ho, Neddie boy!” called Uncle Wigwag, the
gentleman bear, to the little boy bear who was
coming home from school, swinging his books in
a strap that dangled from his paw. “Ho,
Neddie boy, your mamma wants you!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She does?” asked Neddie. “What for?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To go to the store for a bushel of lemons!”
said Uncle Wigwag, waltzing around on one paw,
and holding the other up in the air like a jumping-jack
dancing on top of a frosted cake.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, now I know you’re joking,” said Neddie,
for Uncle Wigwag was a funny old bear gentleman,
always playing tricks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I am joking, just the least little bit,”
admitted Uncle Wigwag, blinking both his eyes
slow and careful like, so as not to get any dust
in them. “But really your mamma does want
you to go to the store. She told me to tell you
just as soon as you came home from school.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What does she want?” asked Neddie. “I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>was going over to Jackie Bow Wow’s house to
play football with him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your mamma wants you to go to the bakery
for a lemon pie,” said Uncle Wigwag, scratching
his left ear with his right paw, which is not
an easy thing to do. “I just said a bushel of
lemons for fun, you know. But really I think I’d
like a pie with a bushel of lemons in.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So would I!” exclaimed Neddie. “I love
lemon pie. I hope mamma wants me to get a big
one, with that funny white of egg stuff and sugar
on top.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s the very kind I want,” said Mrs. Stubtail,
the lady bear, coming to the door just then.
“Get me a large lemon meringue pie, Neddie.
You see we are going to have company to-night,
and really I haven’t time to bake a pie, and Aunt
Piffy is so busy with dusting and sweeping that
she hasn’t either. And as for asking Uncle Wigwag
to make a pie, why I’m afraid he’d play some
joke with it—such as putting in sawdust, or filling
the top with white cotton batting.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I guess maybe I would,” said Uncle
Wigwag, smiling at himself, which is another
hard thing to do. “I will have my joke. But as
long as I have told Neddie what you want of him,
I suppose I may go over and see Grandfather
Goosey Gander now, may I not?” asked the old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>bear gentleman, turning a peppersault as easily
as a cow can blow her horn.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I won’t need you around here, as long
as I have Neddie to run on my errands,” said
Mrs. Stubtail. “But don’t play too many tricks,
Waggy,” she said, calling Uncle Wigwag a pet
name he sometimes went by. “And be sure to
be back here for supper,” went on the lady bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, you may be sure I’ll not miss that!”
exclaimed Uncle Wigwag with a laugh. “I
want some of that lemon pie Neddie is going to
bring home from the baker’s.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So off went Uncle Wigwag to call on Grandfather
Goosey Gander.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where is your sister Beckie?” asked Mrs.
Stubtail, of Neddie, as she gave him the money
to get the pie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, she went over to Susie Littletail’s house,
to talk about wax dolls, I guess,” spoke Neddie.
“She told me to tell you she’ll be home to supper.
I know I’ll be here to supper, anyhow,” went on
Neddie, smacking his lips as he thought of the
lemon pie. “Who are the company, mamma?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. and Mrs. Silver-tip, a new family of
bears who have moved into the cave across the
street,” answered Mrs. Stubtail: “I want to
make them feel at home.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>“Do they like lemon pie?” asked Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I guess so,” said Mrs. Stubtail.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” sighed the little bear cub.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, what’s the matter?” asked his mother.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So many people like lemon pie,” he replied.
“I’m afraid there won’t be enough to go around.
There’s Uncle Wigwag, and—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, don’t worry!” laughed Mrs. Stubtail.
“You may get the largest lemon pie the baker
has.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Neddie felt happy, and off he went to
the baker’s as fast as his paws would take him.
Sometimes he ran along on just his hind feet,
walking almost like a real boy and like the trained
bears you see in the circus. And again Neddie
would drop down on his four feet and go along
that way for a while, like a little poodle doggie.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was quite cold and there was some snow on
the ground. Not as much as the time Neddie
jumped into the big drift, but enough to make
some snowballs. Neddie made a few in his paws,
tossing them up into the air—the snowballs I
mean he tossed, not his paws—and he caught the
snowballs as they came down.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pretty soon Neddie came to the baker’s, and he
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I want the largest lemon pie you have, if you
please.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>“All right,” said Mr. Peetie Skeezex, the
baker, “you shall have it. I have a specially fine
large one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he brought out from the oven the loveliest
lemon meringue pie Neddie had ever seen.
It was almost as large around as a Christmas
drum, and on top was a lot of that white fluffy
stuff made from eggs, and it was browned just
the least little bit, and sprinkled with powdered
sugar, and around the edge was some sort of
curly-cue stuff like twisted rope, and the pie was
as pretty as one picture and part of another
one.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yum-yum!” cried Neddie when he saw
the lemon pie. He could not help it, and he could
hardly stop from taking a taste. But the baker
knew what hungry bear boys might do to a lemon
pie, so Mr. Peetie Skeezex put the lemon pie in
a paper and tied it very tight.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There you are, Neddie,” he said to the little
bear boy. “There’s your pie. Hurry home with
it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will,” answered Neddie. “We’re going to
have it for supper. We’ve got company coming.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fine!” said Mr. Skeezex, giving Neddie a
sweet cake to keep him from getting too hungry
on the way home with the pie. I guess the baker
was afraid that maybe Neddie might bite the pie,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>just to see if it were real. But if Neddie had a
sweet cake of his own to nibble on, this might not
happen.</p>

<p class='c011'>Neddie started for home, carrying the big
lemon pie as carefully as the milkman brings in
a bottle of cream for the cat, and the little boy
bear was about half way to the cave-house, when,
all of a sudden, while he was thinking how he
could get two pieces of pie for supper, all at once
out from behind a mulberry bush jumped an old
sea lion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bur-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r!” roared the sea
lion, shaking his whiskers from side to side.
“Bur-r-r-r-r!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” cried Neddie, standing still with
the lemon pie, he was so frightened. “Oh,
dear!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bur-r-r-r-r-r! Wow! Woff! Snuff!
Bur-r-r-r!” growled the sea lion. “Don’t be
afraid, little bear boy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, now, I leave it to you, wouldn’t anybody
be afraid to be stopped on their way home with a
lemon pie for supper—stopped by a sea lion who
growled like that? I guess they would. Neddie
Stubtail was, anyhow. And by rights, that sea
lion ought to have been in the ocean where he belonged.
But the ocean was so cold, on account
of the ice being in it, that the sea lion had flopped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>out. And now he was going to catch Neddie.
Oh, dear!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t be afraid,” said the sea lion to Neddie.
“I am not going to hurt you. What have you
there?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A lemon pie, if you please,” answered Neddie,
his teeth chattering.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bur-r-r-r-r!” growled the sea lion. “Give it
to me. I am very fond of lemon pie. I like it
better than lollypops.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, if you please,” said Neddie, “this pie
is for supper. We have company coming.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That matters not to me,” said the sea lion.
“Give me that pie!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And then brave Neddie, thinking he must save
the pie, whatever else happened, gave a big jump.
Right over the sea lion’s head he went, and then
how Neddie ran for home!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! You can’t get away like that!” cried
the sea lion, and after Neddie he flopped. Well,
Neddie ran as fast as he could, and the sea lion
flopped as fast as he could, and the bad creature
had almost caught the little bear boy when, all at
once part of the lemon pie slipped off the bottom
crust.</p>

<p class='c011'>Right through a hole in the bag it went, and
into the path it fell, and before the sea lion could
stop himself he had slipped on the slippery lemon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>stuff of the pie and head over flippers he went,
slipping and sliding, until he came to the top of
a hill, and he fell over that and down into a bramble
briar bush, and he didn’t get out for a week
and a day.</p>

<p class='c011'>So Neddie was saved, and he got safely home
with the rest of the pie, and only a little bit had
fallen off, so there was enough left for him and
for Beckie and the company, and even for Uncle
Wigwag.</p>

<p class='c011'>So that’s the story of Neddie and the lemon
pie and if the iceman doesn’t take our refrigerator
home with him to keep his little pussy cat warm
in, I’ll tell you next about Beckie and the cold

  <h2 class='c006'>STORY XXIX<br /> <span class='large'>BECKIE AND THE COLD BIRDIE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, see it snow!” exclaimed Neddie Stubtail,
the little boy bear, as he looked out of the window
of the cave-house. “Look, Beckie!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can’t, Neddie, dear,” said the little girl bear.
“I am making a new dress for my wax doll,
Clarabelle Sarahjane Peartree, and if I look up I
may drop a stitch or two.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, if you drop them I’ll pick them up,” said
Neddie most politely.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beckie laughed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You don’t understand,” she said. “When
you are sewing and drop a stitch it means you let
it slip out of the cloth. It doesn’t drop on the
floor.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t understand,” said Neddie; “I admit
that. But anyhow it’s snowing, and I’m going
out and have some fun.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will come, too, as soon as I get this doll’s
dress done,” answered Beckie. “But I have to
put some frills down the middle and some plaits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>up the side. Then around one edge there is to
go some lace, and on the other some insertion
and——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s enough,” cried Neddie. “I give up!
I’m going out and make a snowball, and there
won’t be any lace on it, nor any tucks, either.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, you boys!” said Beckie with a sigh, as
she threaded her needle with a fine piece of corn
silk that she was using to sew her doll’s dress.</p>

<p class='c011'>So Neddie went out to play in the snow, and
while he was hopping about, making snowballs
and throwing them up in the air to watch them
come down, and now and then rolling over and
over in the snow to make himself look white like
Mr. Whitewash, the polar bear—while Neddie
was doing this, his sister Beckie was sewing her
doll’s dress.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pretty soon she had it nearly finished, so she
laid it aside, and put her needle safely away
where Uncle Wigwag or Aunt Piffy, the fat old
lady bear, would not sit on it by mistake, and
then Beckie went out to play with her brother
Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>The two bear children had lots of fun in the
snow, and in a little while Neddie said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let’s go over in the woods, Beckie. Maybe
we’ll find a lemon pie or a pollylop, or something
like that.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>“What’s a pollylop?” asked Beckie, as she
caught a snowflake on the end of her tongue,
just as the clown in the circus catches a little
piggie by his tail. “I never heard of a pollylop,
Neddie.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why,” said the little bear boy, “a pollylop
is just like a lollypop only different. You see a
lollypop is a stick with a lump of candy on one
end.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, I know that,” answered Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And a pollylop,” went on Neddie, “is a
lump of candy, with a stick on one end.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I see what you mean!” exclaimed
Beckie with a laugh. “One is upside down and
the other——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The other is downside up,” finished her
brother, as he turned a peppersault into a bank
of snow, and came out on the other side with a
feather sticking in his ear.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, look at that!” exclaimed Beckie.
“Where did you get that feather, Neddie?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, I don’t know,” he answered, scratching
his left paw with his right ear. “I guess it
must have come out of the snowbank.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Feathers don’t grow in snowbanks, Neddie,”
spoke Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No more they do,” he answered, taking this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>one from his ear and looking at it. “I guess
this feather must be off a chicken or a turkey,
Beckie.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, it isn’t large enough for a chicken’s or a
turkey’s feather,” said Beckie. “It must be
from a little bird. But what would a bird be
doing in a snowbank?”</p>

<p class='c011'>And just then the two little bear children heard
a voice crying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! How cold I am! Oh, I am almost
frozen!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, the poor thing!” exclaimed Beckie.
“That’s a poor little birdie in the snowbank,
Neddie. You must get him out and we’ll warm
him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How?” asked the little bear boy. “How
can you warm him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I’ll find a way,” said Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right. Then I’ll dive into the snowbank
again,” said Neddie. And into the snow he went,
scattering it carefully about with his paws until,
down near the bottom, on the ground, covered
with the white flakes, and almost frozen, was
a poor little birdie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, the dear little thing!” cried Beckie, as
Neddie brought out the birdie in his paws, holding
it carefully so as not to squeeze it.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>“Cheep! Cheep!” went the cold little birdie.
That was all it could say.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quick, Neddie!” exclaimed Beckie. “You
run home and get me some nice warm milk in a
bottle. Aunt Piffy will heat it for you. Bring it
back here to me, and some bread crumbs, too, I’ll
feed the little birdie.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But why don’t you bring it home with you?”
Neddie wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because I don’t want to carry it through the
cold air,” answered Beckie. “I’m going to warm
the birdie in my fur while you are gone after the
milk.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Neddie ran back home to the cave-house,
and Beckie sat down on a stump that stuck up
above the snow, and in her warm fur Beckie
cuddled the cold birdie, holding her paws over it
to keep off the frosty north wind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Cheep! cheep!” went the small birdie, and
soon it was nice and warm and could flutter its
wings a little.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you feel better now?” asked Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, much better,” answered the fluttering
creature. “Thank you so much for warming
me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But how did you happen to get in the snowbank?”
asked Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>“It was this way,” explained the bird. “Yesterday
all my friends and brothers and sisters
flew away down South, where it is warm. But I
stayed to have a game of tag with Lulu Wibblewobble,
the duck girl, and I was left behind.
Then it got colder and colder, and I could not fly.
I fell into the snow and there I stayed until you
came to get me out. I can never thank you
enough.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pray do not think of that,” said Beckie most
politely. “I am glad we could save you. I suppose
it was your feather that stuck in Neddie’s
ear when he took a peppersault dive through the
snow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” said the birdie, “it was a loose one
from my tail. And it is a good thing it came off,
otherwise you would never have known I was
here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very true,” answered Beckie. Then she
warmed the poor, cold little birdie some more in
her fur, and wondered when Neddie would be
back with the hot milk and the bread crumbs.</p>

<p class='c011'>All of a sudden, as Beckie was sitting there on
the stump, warming the birdie, out from behind
an old apple tree came the biggest fox Beckie had
ever seen. He was much larger than the little
bear girl. In fact, he must have been the grandfather
of all the foxes.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>“Wuff! Wuff! Wuff!” barked the fox. “I
can see where my Christmas dinner is coming
from.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“From where?” asked Beckie, as bravely as
she could, though really she was much frightened.</p>

<p class='c011'>“From you and that bird,” answered the bad
fox. “I am going to carry you both off to my
den, and what a Christmas dinner I will have!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, he was just going to jump and grab
Beckie, when the little birdie that wasn’t cold any
more, but nice and warm, thanks to Beckie’s fur—that
little bird just flew right into the face of
that fox, and with its sharp beak the bird picked
the fox on the end of his nose as hard as anything.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, wow!” cried the fox. “I guess I have
made a mistake! I don’t want a Christmas
dinner off you at all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I guess you don’t!” chirped the birdie, pecking
him on the nose again, and the fox ran away,
taking his bushy tail with him, and Beckie and
the birdie were safe. Then Beckie warmed the
birdie some more in her fur, and pretty soon
along came Neddie with the hot milk and bread
crumbs, and the birdie ate as much as it wanted.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Beckie and Neddie took the birdie home
with them to keep it in the warm cave until summer
should come again; and everybody was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>happy except the fox with the sore nose, and it
served him right. And in the next story, if the
dinner plate doesn’t get hungry and bite a piece
out of the salt dish, I’ll tell you about Neddie
helping Santa Claus.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>STORY XXX<br /> <span class='large'>NEDDIE HELPS SANTA CLAUS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Only three days more until Christmas!
Aren’t you glad, Neddie?” asked Beckie Stubtail,
the little girl bear, one morning as she
jumped out of her bed in the clean straw of the
cave-house where she lived, and ran to the door of
her brother’s room. “Aren’t you just glad,
Neddie?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Glad? Well, I guess I am!” answered
Neddie, as he tickled himself with a clothespin
to make himself laugh. “I don’t even want to
go to school to-day, I’m so happy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, but I s’pose we do have to go,” spoke
Beckie. “But maybe we’ll get out early.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Just then from the kitchen came a call:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hurry, Neddie—Beckie—breakfast is ready!
Come and get your griddle cakes with honey
on!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Beckie and Neddie, the little bear children,
hurried downstairs. Soon they were eating
their breakfast. Their papa, Mr. Stubtail, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>old bear gentleman, had had his breakfast some
time ago and gone to work. Uncle Wigwag, the
gentleman bear, who was always playing tricks
and cracking jokes, as a squirrel cracks nuts, was
sitting in a corner, trying to think of something
new to do to make Aunt Piffy, the fat lady bear,
laugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Whitewash, the Polar bear gentleman,
was out in the yard, looking for a fresh cake of
ice to sit on while he read the morning paper.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pretty soon Neddie and Beckie started for
their classes. They had on their fur coats, for it
was rather cold, you see. And in a little while,
when the bear children were almost at school, and
had met Tommie and Joie and Kat, the kitten
children, in their red mittens and rubber boots,
it began to snow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, how nice!” cried Beckie, jumping about.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s just fine!” exclaimed Neddie. “I always
like it to snow around Christmas, for I’m
going to get a new sled.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I’m going to have a pair of skates,”
said Tommie Kat. “At least I asked Santa
Claus for them, and I hope he brings them, and
also some ice, so I can use them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Whitewash will lend you his cake of ice
to skate on, if the pond doesn’t freeze,” said
Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>And then the school bell rang, and the animal
children had to hurry on, so they would not be
late.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such fun as they had in school that day! It
was so near Christmas that the professor-teacher
was not very strict, and when the children missed
their lessons he gave them another chance.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the Professor let Beckie draw a picture
of Santa Claus on the blackboard, with a red
cap, and fur on the coat and a big pack on his
back—I mean Santa Claus had all these things
on, though of course the blackboard had also,
after Beckie got through drawing.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, when school was out, Neddie and Beckie
ran home with the rest of the animal children,
but, all of a sudden, as the little bear boy came
to the old hollow stump, where Bully, the frog,
used to give jumping lessons in summer, Neddie
happened to think that he had left his reading
book in school.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll run back and get it,” he said. “You go
on, Beckie, and I’ll soon catch up to you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Neddie Stubtail didn’t come back as soon
as he thought he would, for when he got to the
school he found that a little mouse boy had taken
the reading book down a rat hole to look at the
pictures. And by the time Neddie got his book
back it was quite late, and growing dark.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>“But I’m not afraid,” said Neddie as he hurried
on toward home, with the book under his
paw. On and on he went, through the wood.
It became darker and darker. Neddie began
to whistle, so he could not hear any rustling in
the bushes. For when the bushes rustled he
imagined it might be the skillery-scalery alligator,
or maybe a bad wolf after him.</p>

<p class='c011'>But nothing like that took place, and soon
Neddie was almost home. Then all of a sudden
something did happen. Just as he was passing
under a big oak tree, with the brown leaves on
it shaking in the wind, the little bear boy heard
a buzzing sound, and then a crash and a bang,
and a rattle, and some one cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! Now I have gone and done it!
Oh, my, yes! and some reindeer-lollypops besides!
Oh, what am I going to do now? And
not half my work done!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Neddie crouched down under the bushes. He
knew well enough that something had happened
up in the oak tree. What it was he could not
tell.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But if it’s a giant, or a bad elephant or a flying
eagle trying to get me, they shan’t!” exclaimed
Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he heard the voice crying again:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>“Help! Help! Is there anybody around to
help me? I’m stuck in the tree!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha!” exclaimed Neddie to himself. “He’s
only saying that to fool me. I believe that’s the
skillery-scalery alligator sailing around in a
balloon, looking for me. But he shan’t find me.
I’ll hide here until he goes away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Neddie got farther under the bush, and
then the voice cried again:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Help! Help! Please help me!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then some bells jingled, and Neddie heard
a song that went something like this:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Won’t you please come to help me.</div>
      <div class='line'>I am caught fast in a tree.</div>
      <div class='line'>Christmas time will soon be here,</div>
      <div class='line'>But I’ll sure be late this year,</div>
      <div class='line'>Unless some one comes quickly,</div>
      <div class='line'>And gets me loose from out this tree.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Hearing that nice song Neddie wasn’t afraid
any more. He opened his ears as wide as he could
and listened. He opened his eyes as wide as he
could and looked up. Then he saw a strange
sight.</p>

<p class='c011'>Caught fast in the tree was an airship—you
know what they are—a sort of flying balloon,
like a toy circus one, only larger. And in the airship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>was a nice old gentleman, with a red coat and
long white whiskers; and beside him in the airship
was a big bag just filled to the top with sleds
and dolls and rocking horses and cradles, and
steam engines and toy motor boats, and skates
and jumping-jacks, and, oh! I couldn’t begin to
tell you what was in it. Neddie knew right away
who was in trouble.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’re Santa Claus, aren’t you?” he asked,
as he came out from under the bush.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s who I am,” answered the old gentleman.
“I was flying down here from the North
Pole in my airship, when I got caught in the
tree. I’m stuck fast and I can’t get out, and I
don’t know what to do. Can you find some one
to help me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will help you myself,” said Neddie bravely
and kindly. Then, laying down his school books,
he climbed the tree sticking in the bark his sharp
claws as he had learned to do from George, the
tame trained bear, who went around with the
Professor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Soon Neddie was at the top of the tree. Then
he broke off the branches that held fast Santa’s
airship, and dear old St. Nicholas could travel
on again, with his bag of good things for Christmas.</p>

<p class='c011'>Off through the air sailed Santa Claus, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>as Neddie climbed down the tree, after having
helped the nice old gentleman, a voice called.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll see you soon again, Neddie. But don’t
tell anybody you saw me for it’s a secret.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I won’t,” said Neddie, and he didn’t. Then
the little bear boy hurried on home, and he had
honey cakes for supper, and he never said a word
about Santa Claus. And on the next page, if the
umbrella doesn’t climb up the hat tree and pick
off all the breakfast oranges, I’ll tell you about
Neddie and Beckie in the chimney.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>STORY XXXI<br /> <span class='large'>NEDDIE AND BECKIE IN THE CHIMNEY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Neddie, what makes you act so queerly?”
asked Beckie Stubtail, the little bear, one morning
when she and her brother were on their way
to school.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Queer! Do I act queer?” asked Neddie,
as he turned around to see if any snowballs were
growing on the end of his tail. None were, I’m
glad to say.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Queer! I really think you do act strange,”
said Beckie, as politely as she could, while eating
a bun Aunt Piffy had given her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do I do that’s queer?” asked Neddie,
curious-like.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, you go around looking up in the air
all the while, and listening, and then looking up
again. I should think you would get a stiff
neck,” said Beckie. “Why do you do it,
Neddie?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, that’s nothing,” said Neddie, sort of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>confused like. “I—er—I guess I’m looking up
to see if it’s going to snow any more for Christmas.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Neddie Stubtail!” exclaimed Beckie, shaking
her paw at him. “That isn’t it at all!
You’re looking for something in the air and I
know it. And, besides, you talked in your sleep
last night!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did I?” asked Neddie, sort of anxious-like.
“What did I say, Beckie?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I couldn’t understand it all. But it
was something about a tree, and getting caught
in it, and then you hollered out: ‘I won’t tell,
Sandy!’ That’s what you talked.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did I say Sandy?” asked Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, it sounded like that,” answered Beckie.
“But I won’t be sure.” Then she looked at her
brother. Neddie was all sort of red back of his
ears, and his little stubby tail was going wiggle-waggle-wog.
Then Beckie suspected something.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Neddie Stubtail!” she cried. “I believe
you know something about Santa Claus! That’s
it! It was Santa—not Sandy. Oh! Neddie, do
you—really? Tell me, please! I won’t tell.
Come on, do, it’s so near Christmas!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Beckie took hold of Neddie’s paw and kissed
him on the nose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aw, quit!” he cried. “I’m not a girl!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>“I know, Neddie, dear,” said Beckie softly.
“But I love you!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Huh! Yes! I guess you want me to tell
you the secret, don’t you?” he asked, and really
Neddie did not speak as politely as he might
have done. But he did not mean to be unkind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, a secret!” cried Beckie, clapping her
paws. “Do tell me, Neddie, dear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I promised not to,” said the little boy bear,
looking at his toes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, if you will,” said Beckie, “I’ve got a
honey cake, and I’ll give it to you. Do tell me!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well,” said Neddie, slowly, as he ate the
cake his sister gave him, “It happened last
night. I promised not to tell, but then you’re
my sister and it’s almost Christmas, anyhow. I
guess he won’t care.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And then, because he loved his little sister
bear, Neddie told all about having helped Santa
Claus, who got caught in the tree top with his
airship, as I told you in the story before this
one.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, how perfectly lovely!” cried Beckie,
clapping her paws. “Neddie, if I had another
honey cake I’d give it to you. Just to think!
You really saw Santa Claus!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But it’s a secret!” said Neddie, quickly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course—I know,” said Beckie, sticking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>up her nose just the little tiniest bit. “I won’t
tell a single soul.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And then they were at school. They studied
their lessons and then, as it was recess, all the
animal children went out in the yard to play.
And, of course, Beckie had to go and tell that
she had a secret.</p>

<p class='c011'>And, of course, all the girls wanted to know
what the secret was. And, of course, Beckie
said she couldn’t tell, but the girls, like Alice
and Lulu Wibblewobble, the ducks, and Kittie
Kat, and Brighteyes, the guinea pig girl, all
begged and teased, and well——</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now promise, cross your heart and twist
your paws you’ll never, never tell if I tell you,”
asked Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, we promise,” said all the animal girls.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, you can easily guess what happened.
Beckie told how her brother Neddie had helped
Santa Claus out of the tree in his airship. And,
of course, all the girls promised not to even
whisper it. And then, somehow, all the boys
had heard of what happened to Neddie. And,
in a short time, everybody in the school knew all
about the little boy bear having seen Santa
Claus.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, it’s very queer!” exclaimed Beckie
when Neddie spoke to her about it. “I only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>just told a few girls—only a very few, and they
all promised not to tell!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Huh!” exclaimed Neddie. And then, as
he saw that his little sister felt badly, he added:
“Never mind, Beckie. You didn’t mean to, and
I guess Santa Claus won’t care, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And Neddie let Beckie kiss him again, which
was very nice of him, I think.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, when recess was almost over, Jackie
Bow Bow, the puppy dog boy, said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pooh! I don’t believe Santa Claus comes
down the chimney the way they say he does.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You don’t believe that?” cried Neddie Stubtail,
surprised-like.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I don’t,” said Jackie. “Maybe he has
an airship, for you saw that, but nobody ever
saw him come down the chimney.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The idea!” cried Beckie. “What a funny
boy! Of course he comes down the chimney.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How can he with a pack on his back?
Answer me that!” cried Jackie. Neddie and
Beckie looked at one another. They both
thought of the same thing. Then Neddie said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course Santa Claus comes down the
chimney. What if he is big? I’m bigger than
Sammy Littletail, the rabbit, and I can go down
a chimney.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So can I!” cried Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>“And we’ll do it, too!” added Neddie. “We
have a few minutes of recess yet. Beckie and
I will go down the school chimney to show them
all that Santa Claus can do the same thing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, while all the other animal children
looked on in wonder, Beckie and Neddie
scrambled up on the roof of the schoolhouse.
They could easily do this as there was a tree
growing near it. Then Neddie got in the chimney
first. It was a large, wide one.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’ll get all black soot,” said Beckie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind, it will all wash off,” spoke
Neddie. “Come on in, Beckie. There’s lots
of room.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Beckie got in the chimney, too. Just then
the school bell rang. Recess was over. All the
animal children had to run in.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, you’ll get a bad mark!” they cried to
Neddie and Beckie. “You’ll be late!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hurry up! Slide down the chimney and go
to school that way!” cried Beckie to Neddie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can’t! I’m stuck fast!” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll give you a push!” she cried. And she
did. She pushed so hard that both she and
Neddie fell right on down through the hole in
the chimney, into the fireplace in the school
room. But, luckily, there was no fire on the
hearth, so they were not burned. Which shows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>you that Santa Claus can come down a chimney,
and which also shows you that you should not
have a fire in the grate on Christmas eve.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, of course, Neddie and Beckie coming
down the chimney made quite some excitement
in the school, but all the animal children laughed,
and the professor-teacher laughed, too, and then,
as it was so near Christmas, he said there would
be no more lessons that day. So Neddie and
Beckie, having proved that Santa Claus could
come down a chimney, went home to wash off the
soot.</p>

<p class='c011'>What’s that? How does Santa Claus get the
black soot off him when he comes down a chimney?
Why, he always has a whiskbroom with
him, you know, and every time he comes down a
chimney he brushes himself off. See?</p>

<p class='c011'>And now we have come to the end of this book,
for you can easily tell, by looking, that there
isn’t room for another story in it.</p>

<p class='c011'>I’ll just say, though, that Neddie and Beckie
had the finest Christmas that ever you can
imagine. And such presents as they received!
And the candy and nuts and oranges and honey
cakes—Oh, my! It makes me hungry just to
write about it.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the two little bear children, and their
papa and mamma, and Aunt Piffy, the fat bear,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>and Uncle Wigwag, and Mr. Whitewash lived
happily for ever after—for many years after.
And every time he got a chance Uncle Wigwag
would play a joke. And Mr. Whitewash would
always sit on a cake of ice when he could find
one.</p>

<p class='c011'>But if I can’t get any more stories in this
book, I can put them in another. And I will.
That book will be called “Bully and Bawly No-Tail,”
and they will be stories about the two
little frog boys, who lived in a pond, and could
swim as good as a gold fish. They had no tails,
except when they were baby tadpoles, but those
tails soon fell off. So their names were “No-Tail”
you see, just as Buddy and Brighteyes,
the guinea pigs, had no tail.</p>

<p class='c011'>So I’ll say good-bye now, for a little while,
as I have to write the new book for you.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
